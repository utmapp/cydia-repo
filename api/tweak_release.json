This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance.

Hypervisor on iOS requires an M1 iPad.\r\n2. Enabling JIT may require a separate JIT enabler such as [Jitterbug][3] or Jitstreamer.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[3]: https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug"},{"version":"4.0.7","changes":"## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag \"share\" in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

Hypervisor on iOS requires an M1 iPad.\r\n2. Enabling JIT may require a separate JIT enabler such as [Jitterbug][3] or Jitstreamer.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[3]: https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug"},{"version":"4.0.6","changes":"**Remember to back up your VMs before running a beta release of UTM!**\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag \"share\" in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 15.0-15.1.1 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices. Note this means that networking will be broken on some existing VMs and must be re-configured!

On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag \"share\" in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor and it has only been tested on iOS 15.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems.

Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.2.x will be the last update to support iOS 11-13.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.2.x. After that, iOS 14+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.0)\r\n* Checkbox for \"Import VHDX Image\" in the wizard now works correctly again (#3760)\r\n* Fixed various crashes in SPICE webdavd share has been resolved thanks to updated backend (#3633)\r\n* Removed \"cache=writethrough\" argument from block devices since it was added to workaround an issue with VHDX images which we now convert to QCOW2\r\n* Added \"discard=unmap,detect-zeroes=unmap\" argument to block devices to reclaim unused space (#3460)\r\n* When \"do not save screenshot to disk\" is enabled, any existing screenshot will be deleted the next time the VM is started (#3936)\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU additional arguments where it sometimes would not appear after setting it (#3895)\r\n* Fixed RNG device not appearing in console mode even when enabled in the settings (#3790)\r\n* Added support for up to 5 additional mouse buttons (you may need to re-map them in the guest OS as they are automatically set to middle/up/down/side/extra) (#3906)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue in the legacy view where \"invalid identifier\" error may show up on a newly created VM (#3872)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when changing display settings while the VM window is open (but stopped) (#3925)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when trying to select \"Share...\" in context menu (#3915)\r\n* (macOS) Prevent allowing rapid clicking of pause/resume which may lead to VM corruption (#3629)\r\n* (macOS) Show progress indicator while VM is saving to prevent user from terminating the app early and cause corruption (#3752)\r\n* (macOS) Block unsupported Apple USB devices from being captured (#3759)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* iOS 14 and below: There is a known issue crashing while running under taurine but not unc0ver. (#3628)\r\n* Starting a VM shows an empty \"Error\" dialog. This will be fixed in the next release. A workaround is to add `highmem=on` to \"QEMU -> QEMU Machine Properties\".\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues"},{"version":"3.1.5","changes":"*Note: This is the same as v3.1.4 but with a fix for boot issues with the latest Linux kernel.*\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nVisit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* Store .utm bundles anywhere on disk (including on external drives) and import them as a shortcut. See notes below for some limitations.\r\n* Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories\r\n* Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.5)\r\n* Fixed latest Linux kernel failing to boot (\u201cEFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...\u201d) (thanks @agraf for the fix) (#2682)\r\n* Fixed freezing during restart of a GL VM (#3746)\r\n* Clarified that clipboard sharing and auto resolution features are the same setting (#3748)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of \u201clegacy input\u201d introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak \u201cForce PS/2 Controller\u201d in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories.\r\n* Fixed \"Failed to create new bookmark\" when trying to launch a VM shortcut\r\n* Automatically de-toggle UEFI boot tweak on unsupported targets\r\n* Fixed a situation that caused UTM to crash randomly (#3515)\r\n* (iOS 14) Toolbar had large overlapping icons on compact devices\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.2)\r\n* Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)\r\n* Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)\r\n* (iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)\r\n* (iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)\r\n* (macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.1)\r\n* Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)\r\n* Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues\r\n* Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14\r\n* (iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows\r\n* (iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation\r\n* (iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)\r\n* (iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)\r\n* (macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.0)\r\n* Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)\r\n* Refactored backend renderer into [CocoaSpice](https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice)\r\n* Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features\r\n* In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window\r\n* Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)\r\n* Added icon for Pop! OS to picker (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed QEMU custom argument parsing when there is quoted space in middle of the argument (#3579)\r\n* Update the VM screenshot on a timer (#3499)\r\n* Added new global setting to disable saving screenshot to disk\r\n* Improved synchronization of state from the VM window and the main window (play button visible when stopped, busy spinner visible when starting, etc)\r\n* (iOS) Fix crash while installing on older versions of jailbroken iOS (#3543)\r\n* (macOS) Fix an issue where Apple VM aux storage was not created when switching from Linux to macOS boot option\r\n* (macOS) Ability to move a .utm VM to external storage\r\n* (macOS) Toolbar option to delete VM should be disabled when VM is running\r\n* (macOS) Support taking screenshots of Apple VMs\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* iOS 14 and below: There is a known issue crashing while running under taurine but not unc0ver.

After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* This update makes significant changes to the backend of UTM which may have introduced more issues than usual. As a precaution, please make sure you back up your VMs before running this beta in case there are bugs that cause data loss.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.2)\r\n* Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)\r\n* Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks).

Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854\r\n* **QEMU v6.2.0**: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2\r\n* (iOS 13+) **New toolbar**: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023\r\n* (macOS 12+, ARM64) **Virtualize macOS 12**: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS installer directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)\r\n* (macOS 11+) **Virtualize Linux with Apple backend**: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from `cortex-a72` to `default`. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the `cortex-a72` CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). `default` will use the `host` CPU model when virtualization is used and `cortex-a72` when emulation is used.\r\n* The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is **not** marked as \"GPU Supported\".\r\n* The cursor and resolution change issues on ARM64 Windows has been fixed in [SPICE tools 0.164.3][3]. If you are using an older version and experience such issues, please update to the latest SPICE tools.\r\n* If you manually added `virtualization=on` to your VM machine properties, you should remove it.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.4)\r\n* Introduced option to disable RNG device, which causes issues on FreeBSD (#3493)\r\n* Wizard: directory sharing is now enabled by default\r\n* Changed the default USB 3.0 controller from `qemu-xhci` to `nec-usb-xhci` which addresses an issue where the DVD drive disconnects randomly on Windows ARM64 and causes random errors during setup (#3194)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed save panel opening when you try to close the settings (#3494)\r\n* (macOS) Hide unsupported directory sharing options in macOS guests (#3496)\r\n* (macOS) Fix invert scrolling option (thanks @ktprograms) (#3497)\r\n* (macOS) Apple VM config files are now in plain-text (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* (macOS) Hide non-disk drives from the drives icon menu and properly describe the \"EFI Variables\" \"drive\" in settings\r\n* (macOS) Fixed suspend save state being broken in a previous update\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when a toolbar icon is hidden due to small window size and a toolbar option is selected from the menu\r\n* (macOS) The stop button in the main window will now stop the VM if it is started\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: Fix disabled button colour being the same as enabled buttons\r\n* (iOS) Moved the toolbar icon lower to not collide with the touch target for showing control center\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where settings are not shown if the context menu is used to open it (#3513)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.3)\r\n* Improvements to download UI (thanks @conath) (#3432)\r\n* Wizard: various improvements to creating Linux VMs (#3472)\r\n* (iOS) Add licensing text to app settings (#3236)\r\n* (macOS) DMG package now has a pretty icon and background (#3257)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference to terminate when all windows are closed (previously this was the default) (#3483)\r\n* (macOS) Fix custom icon for Apple VMs (#3477)\r\n* (macOS) Fix retina mode support for QEMU VMs (note that previously there was a global preference to enable retina mode that is now removed, per-VM setting should be used instead) (#3471)\r\n* (macOS) Remove QEMU VM setting for \"Fit to Screen\" as it was never implemented for macOS\r\n* ~~(macOS) Remove Apple VM setting for \"Retina (HiDPI) Mode\" as it was confusing and is not used for rendering (it just specifies the size of the virtual monitor)~~ This has been reverted in v3.0.4 and the Retina (HiDPI) Mode has been added back. A use for this feature is if you wish to take screenshots at specific resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.2)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed drive delete/move buttons not appearing on macOS 11 (#3461)\r\n* (macOS) Added missing network entitlement for bridged networking on Apple VMs\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: convert VHDX to QCOW2 when creating a Windows VM\r\n* (macOS) Any imported drive on an interface that is NOT floppy, pflash, or none will be converted to QCOW2.
