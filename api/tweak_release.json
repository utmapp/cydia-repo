Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854\r\n* **QEMU v6.2.0**: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2\r\n* (iOS 13+) **New toolbar**: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023\r\n* (macOS 12+, ARM64) **Virtualize macOS 12**: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS installer directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)\r\n* (macOS 11+) **Virtualize Linux with Apple backend**: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from `cortex-a72` to `default`. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the `cortex-a72` CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). `default` will use the `host` CPU model when virtualization is used and `cortex-a72` when emulation is used.\r\n* The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is **not** marked as \"GPU Supported\".\r\n* The cursor and resolution change issues on ARM64 Windows has been fixed in [SPICE tools 0.164.3][3]. If you are using an older version and experience such issues, please update to the latest SPICE tools.\r\n* If you manually added `virtualization=on` to your VM machine properties, you should remove it.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.4)\r\n* Introduced option to disable RNG device, which causes issues on FreeBSD (#3493)\r\n* Wizard: directory sharing is now enabled by default\r\n* Changed the default USB 3.0 controller from `qemu-xhci` to `nec-usb-xhci` which addresses an issue where the DVD drive disconnects randomly on Windows ARM64 and causes random errors during setup (#3194)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed save panel opening when you try to close the settings (#3494)\r\n* (macOS) Hide unsupported directory sharing options in macOS guests (#3496)\r\n* (macOS) Fix invert scrolling option (thanks @ktprograms) (#3497)\r\n* (macOS) Apple VM config files are now in plain-text (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* (macOS) Hide non-disk drives from the drives icon menu and properly describe the \"EFI Variables\" \"drive\" in settings\r\n* (macOS) Fixed suspend save state being broken in a previous update\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when a toolbar icon is hidden due to small window size and a toolbar option is selected from the menu\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: Fix disabled button colour being the same as enabled buttons\r\n* (iOS) Moved the toolbar icon lower to not collide with the touch target for showing control center\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where settings are not shown if the context menu is used to open it (#3513)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.3)\r\n* Improvements to download UI (thanks @conath) (#3432)\r\n* Wizard: various improvements to creating Linux VMs (#3472)\r\n* (iOS) Add licensing text to app settings (#3236)\r\n* (macOS) DMG package now has a pretty icon and background (#3257)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference to terminate when all windows are closed (previously this was the default) (#3483)\r\n* (macOS) Fix custom icon for Apple VMs (#3477)\r\n* (macOS) Fix retina mode support for QEMU VMs (note that previously there was a global preference to enable retina mode that is now removed, per-VM setting should be used instead) (#3471)\r\n* (macOS) Remove QEMU VM setting for \"Fit to Screen\" as it was never implemented for macOS\r\n* ~~(macOS) Remove Apple VM setting for \"Retina (HiDPI) Mode\" as it was confusing and is not used for rendering (it just specifies the size of the virtual monitor)~~ This has been reverted in v3.0.4 and the Retina (HiDPI) Mode has been added back. A use for this feature is if you wish to take screenshots at specific resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.2)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed drive delete/move buttons not appearing on macOS 11 (#3461)\r\n* (macOS) Added missing network entitlement for bridged networking on Apple VMs\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: convert VHDX to QCOW2 when creating a Windows VM\r\n* (macOS) Any imported drive on an interface that is NOT floppy, pflash, or none will be converted to QCOW2. This does not apply to removable drives.\r\n* (iOS) Improved toolbar visibility and dimming while idle behaviour\r\n* Wizard: skip drive creation if rootfs image is selected\r\n* Fixed an issue where an imported drive does not use the selected interface\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.1)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed launching on macOS 11 (#3433)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed \"auxiliaryStorage is nil\" when creating macOS VM on M1 Mac (thanks @pointum) (#3429)\r\n* (iOS) Proper enablement of extended RAM usage on M1 iPad 16GB (thanks @kkk669)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash on VM launch on < iOS 13 due to toolbar not being initialized\r\n* (iOS) Version information will now be shown in the system Settings app for UTM (at the bottom)\r\n* Fixed cursor and screen resolution issues on ARM64 Windows after installing SPICE tools. Requires updating SPICE tools to [latest version][3].\r\n* Add virtio-rng-pci device to fix boot warning about randomness source (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Default upscaling mode is now \"nearest neighbor\"\r\n* Fixed floppy drives being read-only (thanks @conath) (#3333)\r\n* Wizard: no longer use NVMe for Windows on x86_64 systems\r\n* Fixed a regression where Windows boots into BSOD often on x86_64 virtualization\r\n* Updated localization for Zh-Hant (thanks @pan93412)\r\n* Updated localization for Zh-Hans (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed an issue where sometimes a VM will not boot due to invalid drive id (thanks @conath) (#3388)\r\n* Changing target to PC (i440FX) will now turn off hypervisor on x86_64 by default because it is unstable (#2420)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.0)\r\n* Added VM creation wizard\r\n* Updated QEMU to v6.2.0\r\n* Updated ANGLE to latest commit\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest commit (this may fix #2743)\r\n* Added `default` and `host` CPU option for ARM64 virtual machines. This will be the default for newly created VMs.\r\n* The downloader will no longer perform CRC checks on the ZIP file and this will significantly speed up extraction.\r\n* (iOS 13+) Redesigned toolbar (#496)\r\n* (macOS) Redesigned VM settings\r\n* (macOS) Fix crash moving drives (#3117)\r\n* (macOS) Make HVF per-VM configurable (#2493)\r\n* (macOS) Add Apple Virtualization.framework backend\r\n* (macOS) New Terminal frontend with SwiftTerm, currently only used with Apple backend on macOS\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization supports virtual serial port through PTY device\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[3]: https://mac.getutm.app/support/"},{"version":"3.0.3","changes":"## Installation\r\nVisit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **Wizard for VM creation**: Easily create a new VM with the correct default settings with a guided step-by-step wizard.

Additionally, dynamic resolution (auto-change resolution when VM window is resized) and more fixed resolutions (matching all the screen resolutions of the latest Mac computers) were added to the driver. This requires you to download the latest SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ and run the installer again (or manually updating your GPU driver from the ISO if you know how).\r\n* In v2.4.0, newly created Q35 and PC machine (x86 and x86_64) defaulted to the `Skylake-Client` CPU model. Subsequently, it was discovered that the change caused performance regressions. v2.4.1 reverted the default CPU model to `Default` but if you created a new Q35/PC VM in v2.4.0, it is recommended that you manually change the CPU in System settings to `Default`.\r\n* Since v1.0.0, UTM used the RTL8139 network card as the default for Q35 VMs (x86 and x86_64) and Virt VMs (ARM64). There is a bug in the device implementation that causes the Windows driver to freeze the system and many users reported Windows Installer freezing as well as random freezes through normal use. In v2.4.0, we changed the default network card for Virt machines to `virtio-net-pci` and in v2.4.1, we changed the default network card for Q35 machines to E1000. However, this change only applies to newly created VMs, and any existing VMs may still suffer from the random freeze issues. It is recommended that you change your network card to `e1000` for Q35 machines and `virtio-net-pci` for Virt machines. Windows 7 and above should have the Intel E1000 network card drivers already installed, but the VirtIO Network card requires drivers in the SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ (if you previously installed this, you should have the drivers already on your system).\r\n* (macOS) Since v2.1.2, UTM provided an option (Cmd+,) to \"Use only performance cores by default\" which defaulted to off. When on, any VM which does not have a manually configured CPU count (> 0) will set the CPU count to the number of performance cores on the system. In v2.4.1, we have made this option on by default which means if you previously have not modified this option, then it will now be on. If you turned the option on, it should not change and if you turned the option on and later off again, it should still be off. The reason for this change was because users may not be aware of this option which can result in degraded performance when left off and we believe the default should reflect the best possible performance. Note that as before, if you manually set a VM's CPU count > 0, then this option does not change anything.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* (iOS) Integrated AltKit for automatically triggering AltJIT when installed with AltStore (1.5b2+) and AltServer (1.5b8+) (thanks @JoeMatt)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed sandbox issues (cannot select file) on jailbroken devices (thanks @Halo-Michael)\r\n* Improved zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed inverted mouse cursor colour in Windows\r\n* New VMs will only use PCores by default (unless manually overridden with Preferences or per-VM config), this also fixes #3180\r\n* Changed default Q35 audio card to intel-hda\r\n* Changed default Q35 network card to E1000 and Virt network card to virtio-net (#3130)\r\n* Removed default CPU for Q35 and PC configurations because the Skylake-Client CPU resulted in performance regression (#3249)\r\n* Fixed downloadVM URL action when the ZIP name collides with the .utm name (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed a race condition leading to crash when a VM is shut down suddenly\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues"},{"version":"2.4.0","changes":"## Installation\r\nVisit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## New Features (Summary)\r\n* Improved support for SPARC and S390x\r\n* Updated macOS icon thanks to a real designer (@JackHinkle)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* Fixed crash when trying to pause a GL accelerated VM (#3207)\r\n* Configuration should reset more settings when changing architecture\r\n* Fixed UTM exit when deleting a VM\r\n* Fixed an incorrect mapping of removable drives causing an error \"device not removable\" when drives are moved around.\r\n* On ARM64 virt systems, use the virtual USB 3.0 bus for the virtual DVD drive, should improve read times and fix some Windows installer issues (#3194) (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed a crash booting OpenBSD (#3197) (thanks @agraf)\r\n* Fixed a crash caused by a race condition when an error occurs during VM launch\r\n* (macOS) Keyboard mapping accidentally swapped left/right Cmd and Option (#3175) (thanks @zeldin)\r\n* (macOS) Removed \"beep\" when pressing Cmd+key while mouse is not captured (#3217)\r\n* (macOS) Pass Ctrl+Tab to VM even when not captured because it is a common shortcut.

Use `virtio-ramfb-gl` or `virtio-vga-gl` display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration. Note that newly created VMs will default to a \"GPU Supported\" display device on supported architectures but existing VMs must manually change the display device in Display settings. GPU acceleration is still an experimental feature, so it may not work in some situations (including many 3D use cases).\r\n* **EFI Boot**. By default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -> System -> Advanced Configuration -> UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs).
