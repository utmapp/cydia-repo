                <p><p>UTM is a full featured virtual machine host for iOS. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Android, and more on your iPhone and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/</p>
<p>This package <strong>requires</strong> AppSync Unified from Karen's Repo. Make sure to add <a href="cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/">https://cydia.akemi.ai/</a> to your repository list before installing!</p>
<p><strong>Note upgrading from &lt; v2.0.22:</strong> The old version of this package installs UTM to /Applications (just like other jailbreak apps). This was an issue because UTM uses sandboxed features and was partially broken when installed that way. Since AppSync Unified was released for iOS 14, UTM now installs the sandboxed IPA directly and as a result your old VMs will not be visible. If you had an older version installed, you need to move your VMs from <code>/var/mobile/Documents</code> to a temporary location and then open it from the built-in Files app to import it into the UTM sandbox location. Then, you can delete the old files.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V thanks to QEMU as a backend</li>
<li>Fast native graphics through para-virtualization thanks to SPICE</li>
<li>JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG</li>
<li>Frontend designed from scratch for iOS11+ using the latest and greatest APIs</li>
<li>Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to keep your VMs, make sure to back them up before uninstalling.</li>
<li>Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not). To be safe, make sure you never allocate more storage to a VM than the amount of free space you have.</li>

                <h4>4.1.6</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p>This is the same release as v4.1.5 but with the change to default enable GPU acceleration for Linux reverted. This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to <code>virtio-gpu-pci</code> or another card that does not have <code>-gl</code> in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0</strong>. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)</li>
<li><strong>Improved renderer backend</strong>. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT</strong>. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)</strong>. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface</strong>. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in <code>UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl</code> (which you can symlink to <code>/usr/local/bin/utmctl</code> if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.</li>
<li>(macOS 13+) <strong>Menu bar extra</strong>. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use <code>virtio-gpu-gl-pci</code> by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to <code>virtio-ramfb</code> or <code>virtio-vga</code>.~~</li>
<li>Newly created Windows VMs will now use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> (Apple Silicon) or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a <code>-gl</code> display card.</li>
<li>(iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as <code>glxgears</code> will not work with the Metal backend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.6)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for &quot;Hardware OpenGL Acceleration&quot; which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.</li>
<li>Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.</li>
<li>Newly created Windows VMs will now use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> (Apple Silicon) or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)</li>
<li>Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.</li>
<li>CLI: Improved some help text.</li>
<li>Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus</li>
<li>Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now</li>
<li>Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)</li>
<li>(iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as <code>glxgears</code> not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)</li>
<li>(macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated QEMU to v7.2.0</li>
<li>Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs</li>
<li>Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)</li>
<li>Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience</li>
<li>Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration</li>
<li>Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system</li>
<li>Fixed crash due to an error with <code>GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID</code> (#4722)</li>
<li>Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)</li>
<li>Fixed crash in <code>-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]</code> (#3519)</li>
<li>Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)</li>
<li>Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)</li>
<li>Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore build: use <code>com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox</code> instead of <code>com.apple.private.security.no-container</code> on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing &quot;Open&quot; in the wizard (#4842)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)</li>
<li>(macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings</li>
<li>(macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when <code>utmctl help attach</code> runs (#4817)</li>
<li>(macOS) utmctl: Fixed <code>utmctl stop</code> with <code>--request</code> and <code>kill</code> (#4850)</li>

                <h4>4.1.5</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0</strong>. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)</li>
<li><strong>Improved renderer backend</strong>. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT</strong>. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)</strong>. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface</strong>. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in <code>UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl</code> (which you can symlink to <code>/usr/local/bin/utmctl</code> if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.</li>
<li>(macOS 13+) <strong>Menu bar extra</strong>. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>Newly created Linux VMs will now use <code>virtio-gpu-gl-pci</code> by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to <code>virtio-ramfb</code> or <code>virtio-vga</code>.</li>
<li>Newly created Windows VMs will now use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> (Apple Silicon) or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a <code>-gl</code> display card.</li>
<li>(iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as <code>glxgears</code> will not work with the Metal backend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.</li>
<li>Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.</li>
<li>Newly created Windows VMs will now use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> (Apple Silicon) or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)</li>
<li>Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.</li>
<li>CLI: Improved some help text.</li>
<li>Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus</li>
<li>Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now</li>
<li>Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)</li>
<li>(iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as <code>glxgears</code> not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)</li>
<li>(macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated QEMU to v7.2.0</li>
<li>Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs</li>
<li>Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)</li>
<li>Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience</li>
<li>Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration</li>
<li>Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system</li>
<li>Fixed crash due to an error with <code>GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID</code> (#4722)</li>
<li>Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)</li>
<li>Fixed crash in <code>-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]</code> (#3519)</li>
<li>Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)</li>
<li>Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)</li>
<li>Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore build: use <code>com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox</code> instead of <code>com.apple.private.security.no-container</code> on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing &quot;Open&quot; in the wizard (#4842)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)</li>
<li>(macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings</li>

                <h4>4.1.2</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QEMU backend updated to v7.1.0</strong></li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT</strong>. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface</strong>. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in <code>UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl</code> (which you can symlink to <code>/usr/local/bin/utmctl</code> if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.</li>
<li>(macOS 13+) <strong>Menu bar extra</strong>. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>

                <h4>4.0.9</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>
<li><strong>Ventura updates to Virtualization.</strong> macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.</li>
<li><strong>VirtFS sharing for QEMU.</strong> This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run <code>chown</code> in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.</strong> You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an &quot;Autounattend.xml&quot; which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Resize QEMU disk images.</strong> In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.</strong> With the release of <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore</a>, you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.</li>
<li><strong>New documentation site.</strong> https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.</li>
<li><strong>New localization.</strong> Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>
<li>Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify <code>/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml</code> and change the adapter name from <code>enp0s9</code> (or whatever it is currently) to <code>enp0s1</code> (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.</li>

            </div><div class="changelog_entry">
                <h4>4.0.8</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p><strong>Update [20/10/22]</strong>: UTM SE build was removed and replaced with version v3.2.3 because of a bug that prevents any VM from starting up. If you have installed UTM SE v4.0.8, please re-install v3.2.3 or wait for the next update.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>
<li><strong>Ventura updates to Virtualization.</strong> macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.</li>
<li><strong>VirtFS sharing for QEMU.</strong> This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run <code>chown</code> in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.</strong> You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an &quot;Autounattend.xml&quot; which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Resize QEMU disk images.</strong> In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.</strong> With the release of <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore</a>, you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.</li>
<li><strong>New documentation site.</strong> https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.</li>
<li><strong>New localization.</strong> Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>
<li>Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify <code>/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml</code> and change the adapter name from <code>enp0s9</code> (or whatever it is currently) to <code>enp0s1</code> (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.</li>

                <h4>4.0.7</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>
<li><strong>Ventura updates to Virtualization.</strong> macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.</li>
<li><strong>VirtFS sharing for QEMU.</strong> This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag &quot;share&quot; in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.</strong> You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an &quot;Autounattend.xml&quot; which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Resize QEMU disk images.</strong> In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.</strong> With the release of <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore</a>, you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.</li>
<li><strong>New documentation site.</strong> https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>
<li>Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify <code>/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml</code> and change the adapter name from <code>enp0s9</code> (or whatever it is currently) to <code>enp0s1</code> (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.</li>

            </div><div class="changelog_entry">
                <h4>4.0.5</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p><strong>Remember to back up your VMs before running a beta release of UTM!</strong></p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>
<li><strong>Ventura updates to Virtualization.</strong> macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.</li>
<li><strong>VirtFS sharing for QEMU.</strong> This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag &quot;share&quot; in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.</strong> You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an &quot;Autounattend.xml&quot; which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Resize QEMU disk images.</strong> In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.</strong> With the release of <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore</a>, you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 15.0-15.1.1 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>
</ul>

                <h4>4.0.4</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p><strong>Remember to back up your VMs before running a beta release of UTM!</strong></p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>
<li><strong>Ventura updates to Virtualization.</strong> macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.</li>
<li><strong>VirtFS sharing for QEMU.</strong> This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag &quot;share&quot; in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.</strong> You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an &quot;Autounattend.xml&quot; which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Resize QEMU disk images.</strong> In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.</strong> With the release of <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore</a>, you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor and it has only been tested on iOS 15.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>

                <div class="md_view"><p><strong>Remember to back up your VMs before running a beta release of UTM!</strong></p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p><strong>iOS</strong>: Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.
<strong>macOS</strong>: Download &quot;UTM.dmg&quot; below and copy the contents to your <code>/Applications</code> directory.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>
<li><strong>Ventura updates to Virtualization.</strong> macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.</li>
<li><strong>Virtiofs sharing for QEMU.</strong> This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag &quot;share&quot; in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.0.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed &quot;view.plist&quot; for host-specific configuration settings (i.e. bookmarks to removable drives and window options) and replaced it with a new &quot;registry&quot; that is stored outside of the .utm bundle. Old &quot;view.plist&quot; settings and bookmarks will be migrated to the registry on first launch and the file will be deleted from the .utm bundle. For Apple VMs, the bookmarks will no longer be stored in config.plist and the settings will be migrated to the registry as well.</li>

<strong>macOS</strong>: Download &quot;UTM.dmg&quot; below and copy the contents to your <code>/Applications</code> directory.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QEMU 7.0.0</strong>: The backend has been updated to the latest release. Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.</li>
<li><strong>Reclaiming space</strong>: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.</li>
<li><strong>Disposable mode</strong>: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select &quot;Run without saving changes&quot; to start VM in &quot;disposable mode.&quot; In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reminder: for troubleshooting common Windows install issues (such as no networking), please check out the <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-10">guide</a> or <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04">this guide</a> for Ubuntu install issues.</li>
<li>If you manually added <code>highmem=on</code> or <code>highmem=off</code> to your QEMU Machine Properties as a workaround to issues in a previous release, please remove it.</li>

                <div class="md_view"><h2>Installation</h2>
<p><strong>iOS</strong>: Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.
<strong>macOS</strong>: Download &quot;UTM.dmg&quot; below and copy the contents to your <code>/Applications</code> directory.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QEMU 7.0.0</strong>: The backend has been updated to the latest release. Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.</li>
<li><strong>Reclaiming space</strong>: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.</li>
<li><strong>Disposable mode</strong>: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select &quot;Run without saving changes&quot; to start VM in &quot;disposable mode.&quot; In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Reminder: for troubleshooting common Windows install issues (such as no networking), please check out the <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-10">guide</a>.</li>
<li>If you manually added <code>highmem=on</code> or <code>highmem=off</code> to your QEMU Machine Properties as a workaround to issues in a previous release, please remove it.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>UTM v3.2.x will be the last update to support iOS 11-13.</strong> If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.2.x. After that, iOS 14+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.</li>

                <div class="md_view"><p><em>Note: This is the same as v3.1.4 but with a fix for boot issues with the latest Linux kernel.</em></p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Store .utm bundles anywhere on disk (including on external drives) and import them as a shortcut. See notes below for some limitations.</li>
<li>Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories</li>
<li>Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) <strong>UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.</strong> If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.</li>
<li>You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting &quot;Move...&quot; Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using &quot;File -&gt; Import Virtual Machine...&quot; Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is <em>always</em> deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.</li>
<li>Default machine properties will now always be included <em>unless</em> explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property <code>highmem=off</code> will be appended unless the user specifies <code>highmem=on</code> in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select <code>virt</code> in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with <code>highmem=off</code>. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires <code>highmem=off</code>. Advanced users can still specify <code>highmem=on</code> and it will not be overridden.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed latest Linux kernel failing to boot (“EFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...”) (thanks @agraf for the fix) (#2682)</li>
<li>Fixed freezing during restart of a GL VM (#3746)</li>
<li>Clarified that clipboard sharing and auto resolution features are the same setting (#3748)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The changes to behaviour of “legacy input” introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak “Force PS/2 Controller” in the QEMU settings. (#3723)</li>
<li>The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)</li>
<li>&quot;Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines&quot; shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)</li>
<li>Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>(iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Hotfix</em>: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed</li>
<li>Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.</li>
<li>The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)</li>
<li>Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding <code>virtualization=on</code> machine property (#3703)</li>
<li>Default machine properties will always be included <em>unless</em> explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)</li>
<li>Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories.</li>
<li>Fixed &quot;Failed to create new bookmark&quot; when trying to launch a VM shortcut</li>
<li>Automatically de-toggle UEFI boot tweak on unsupported targets</li>
<li>Fixed a situation that caused UTM to crash randomly (#3515)</li>
<li>(iOS 14) Toolbar had large overlapping icons on compact devices</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)</li>
<li>Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.</li>
<li>Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations</li>
<li>Show &quot;unavailable&quot; VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)</li>
<li>Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)</li>
<li>Rename &quot;import&quot; menu to &quot;open&quot; to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the &quot;open&quot; option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it</li>
<li>New context menu option &quot;New from template...&quot; can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)</li>
<li>Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in &quot;busy&quot; state</li>
<li>Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when &quot;legacy input&quot; is off. Renamed &quot;legacy input&quot; to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)</li>
<li>Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed launching on &lt; iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)</li>
<li>Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -&gt; Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)</li>
<li>(iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)</li>
<li>(iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)</li>
<li>(macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)</li>
<li>Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues</li>
<li>Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)</li>
<li>(iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14</li>
<li>(iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows</li>
<li>(iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation</li>
<li>(iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)</li>
<li>(iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)</li>
<li>(macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.0)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)</li>

<li>Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)</li>
<li>Added icon for Pop! OS to picker (thanks @conath)</li>
<li>Fixed QEMU custom argument parsing when there is quoted space in middle of the argument (#3579)</li>
<li>Update the VM screenshot on a timer (#3499)</li>
<li>Added new global setting to disable saving screenshot to disk</li>
<li>Improved synchronization of state from the VM window and the main window (play button visible when stopped, busy spinner visible when starting, etc)</li>

                <div class="md_view"><h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Store .utm bundles anywhere on disk (including on external drives) and import them as a shortcut. See notes below for some limitations.</li>
<li>Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories</li>
<li>Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) <strong>UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.</strong> If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.</li>
<li>You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting &quot;Move...&quot; Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using &quot;File -&gt; Import Virtual Machine...&quot; Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is <em>always</em> deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.</li>
<li>Default machine properties will now always be included <em>unless</em> explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property <code>highmem=off</code> will be appended unless the user specifies <code>highmem=on</code> in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select <code>virt</code> in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with <code>highmem=off</code>. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires <code>highmem=off</code>. Advanced users can still specify <code>highmem=on</code> and it will not be overridden.</li>
</ul>

<li>Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when &quot;legacy input&quot; is off. Renamed &quot;legacy input&quot; to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)</li>
<li>Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed launching on &lt; iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)</li>
<li>Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -&gt; Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)</li>
<li>(iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)</li>
<li>(iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)</li>
<li>(macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)</li>
<li>Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues</li>
<li>Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)</li>
<li>(iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14</li>
<li>(iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows</li>
<li>(iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation</li>
<li>(iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)</li>
<li>(iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)</li>
<li>(macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.0)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)</li>
<li>Refactored backend renderer into <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice">CocoaSpice</a></li>
<li>Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features</li>
<li>In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window</li>
<li>Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)</li>
<li>Added icon for Pop! OS to picker (thanks @conath)</li>
<li>Fixed QEMU custom argument parsing when there is quoted space in middle of the argument (#3579)</li>
<li>Update the VM screenshot on a timer (#3499)</li>
<li>Added new global setting to disable saving screenshot to disk</li>
<li>Improved synchronization of state from the VM window and the main window (play button visible when stopped, busy spinner visible when starting, etc)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fix crash while installing on older versions of jailbroken iOS (#3543)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix an issue where Apple VM aux storage was not created when switching from Linux to macOS boot option</li>
<li>(macOS) Ability to move a .utm VM to external storage</li>
<li>(macOS) Toolbar option to delete VM should be disabled when VM is running</li>
<li>(macOS) Support taking screenshots of Apple VMs</li>

<p>Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>Store .utm bundles anywhere on disk (including on external drives) and import them as a shortcut. See notes below for some limitations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) <strong>UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.</strong> If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.</li>
<li>This update makes significant changes to the backend of UTM which may have introduced more issues than usual. As a precaution, please make sure you back up your VMs before running this beta in case there are bugs that cause data loss.</li>
<li>You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting &quot;Move...&quot; Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using &quot;File -&gt; Import Virtual Machine...&quot; Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is <em>always</em> deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.</li>
