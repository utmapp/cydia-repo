                <p><p>UTM is a full featured virtual machine host for iOS. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Android, and more on your iPhone and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/</p>
<p>This package <strong>requires</strong> AppSync Unified from Karen's Repo. Make sure to add <a href="cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/">https://cydia.akemi.ai/</a> to your repository list before installing!</p>
<p><strong>Note upgrading from &lt; v2.0.22:</strong> The old version of this package installs UTM to /Applications (just like other jailbreak apps). This was an issue because UTM uses sandboxed features and was partially broken when installed that way. Since AppSync Unified was released for iOS 14, UTM now installs the sandboxed IPA directly and as a result your old VMs will not be visible. If you had an older version installed, you need to move your VMs from <code>/var/mobile/Documents</code> to a temporary location and then open it from the built-in Files app to import it into the UTM sandbox location. Then, you can delete the old files.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V thanks to QEMU as a backend</li>
<li>Fast native graphics through para-virtualization thanks to SPICE</li>
<li>JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG</li>
<li>Frontend designed from scratch for iOS11+ using the latest and greatest APIs</li>
<li>Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to keep your VMs, make sure to back them up before uninstalling.</li>
<li>Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not). To be safe, make sure you never allocate more storage to a VM than the amount of free space you have.</li>
</ul>

                <h4>4.0.7</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>
<li><strong>Ventura updates to Virtualization.</strong> macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.</li>
<li><strong>VirtFS sharing for QEMU.</strong> This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag &quot;share&quot; in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.</strong> You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an &quot;Autounattend.xml&quot; which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Resize QEMU disk images.</strong> In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.</strong> With the release of <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore</a>, you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.</li>
<li><strong>New documentation site.</strong> https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>
<li>Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify <code>/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml</code> and change the adapter name from <code>enp0s9</code> (or whatever it is currently) to <code>enp0s1</code> (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.</li>

<li><strong>VirtFS sharing for QEMU.</strong> This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag &quot;share&quot; in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.</strong> You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an &quot;Autounattend.xml&quot; which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Resize QEMU disk images.</strong> In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.</strong> With the release of <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore</a>, you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 15.0-15.1.1 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>
<li>Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify <code>/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml</code> and change the adapter name from <code>enp0s9</code> (or whatever it is currently) to <code>enp0s1</code> (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.</li>
</ul>

                <div class="md_view"><p><strong>Remember to back up your VMs before running a beta release of UTM!</strong></p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>

                <h4>4.0.4</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p><strong>Remember to back up your VMs before running a beta release of UTM!</strong></p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>
<li><strong>Ventura updates to Virtualization.</strong> macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.</li>
<li><strong>VirtFS sharing for QEMU.</strong> This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag &quot;share&quot; in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.</strong> You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an &quot;Autounattend.xml&quot; which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Resize QEMU disk images.</strong> In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.</strong> With the release of <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore</a>, you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor and it has only been tested on iOS 15.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>

                <h4>4.0.2</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p><strong>Remember to back up your VMs before running a beta release of UTM!</strong></p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p><strong>iOS</strong>: Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.
<strong>macOS</strong>: Download &quot;UTM.dmg&quot; below and copy the contents to your <code>/Applications</code> directory.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.</strong> You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.</li>
<li><strong>Ventura updates to Virtualization.</strong> macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.</li>
<li><strong>Virtiofs sharing for QEMU.</strong> This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag &quot;share&quot; in the VM. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may need to set up your guest to have permission to access the shared directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.0.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed &quot;view.plist&quot; for host-specific configuration settings (i.e. bookmarks to removable drives and window options) and replaced it with a new &quot;registry&quot; that is stored outside of the .utm bundle. Old &quot;view.plist&quot; settings and bookmarks will be migrated to the registry on first launch and the file will be deleted from the .utm bundle. For Apple VMs, the bookmarks will no longer be stored in config.plist and the settings will be migrated to the registry as well.</li>
<li>Virtiofs no longer requires SPICE to be enabled (thanks @tie)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with PPC VMs not showing 256 colours correctly (#4277)</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect parsing of CPU flags (#4282)</li>
<li>Do not save screenshots when running in disposable mode</li>

<li>(iOS) Per-display window settings (zoom, position, keyboard visibility, etc) will be stored in the new registry</li>
<li>(iOS) Prefer JitStreamer over AltJit when both are available (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed saving removable drives and shared directories for Apple VMs</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed missing audio entitlements (#4342)</li>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QEMU 7.0.0</strong>: The backend has been updated to the latest release. Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.</li>
<li><strong>Reclaiming space</strong>: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.</li>
<li><strong>Disposable mode</strong>: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select &quot;Run without saving changes&quot; to start VM in &quot;disposable mode.&quot; In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)</li>

<li><strong>Reclaiming space</strong>: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.</li>
<li><strong>Disposable mode</strong>: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select &quot;Run without saving changes&quot; to start VM in &quot;disposable mode.&quot; In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)</li>

                <h4>3.1.5</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p><em>Note: This is the same as v3.1.4 but with a fix for boot issues with the latest Linux kernel.</em></p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Store .utm bundles anywhere on disk (including on external drives) and import them as a shortcut. See notes below for some limitations.</li>
<li>Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories</li>
<li>Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) <strong>UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.</strong> If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.</li>
<li>You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting &quot;Move...&quot; Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using &quot;File -&gt; Import Virtual Machine...&quot; Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is <em>always</em> deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.</li>
<li>Default machine properties will now always be included <em>unless</em> explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property <code>highmem=off</code> will be appended unless the user specifies <code>highmem=on</code> in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select <code>virt</code> in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with <code>highmem=off</code>. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires <code>highmem=off</code>. Advanced users can still specify <code>highmem=on</code> and it will not be overridden.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed latest Linux kernel failing to boot (“EFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...”) (thanks @agraf for the fix) (#2682)</li>
<li>Fixed freezing during restart of a GL VM (#3746)</li>
<li>Clarified that clipboard sharing and auto resolution features are the same setting (#3748)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The changes to behaviour of “legacy input” introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak “Force PS/2 Controller” in the QEMU settings. (#3723)</li>
<li>The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)</li>
<li>&quot;Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines&quot; shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)</li>
<li>Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>(iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Hotfix</em>: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed</li>
<li>Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.</li>
<li>The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)</li>
<li>Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding <code>virtualization=on</code> machine property (#3703)</li>
<li>Default machine properties will always be included <em>unless</em> explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)</li>
<li>Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories.</li>
<li>Fixed &quot;Failed to create new bookmark&quot; when trying to launch a VM shortcut</li>
<li>Automatically de-toggle UEFI boot tweak on unsupported targets</li>
<li>Fixed a situation that caused UTM to crash randomly (#3515)</li>
<li>(iOS 14) Toolbar had large overlapping icons on compact devices</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)</li>
<li>Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.</li>
<li>Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations</li>
<li>Show &quot;unavailable&quot; VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)</li>
<li>Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)</li>
<li>Rename &quot;import&quot; menu to &quot;open&quot; to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the &quot;open&quot; option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it</li>
<li>New context menu option &quot;New from template...&quot; can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)</li>
<li>Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in &quot;busy&quot; state</li>
<li>Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when &quot;legacy input&quot; is off. Renamed &quot;legacy input&quot; to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)</li>
<li>Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed launching on &lt; iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)</li>
<li>Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -&gt; Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)</li>
<li>(iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)</li>
<li>(iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)</li>
<li>(macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)</li>
<li>Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues</li>
<li>Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)</li>
<li>(iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14</li>
<li>(iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows</li>
<li>(iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation</li>
<li>(iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)</li>
<li>(iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)</li>
<li>(macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.0)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)</li>
<li>Refactored backend renderer into <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice">CocoaSpice</a></li>
<li>Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features</li>
<li>In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window</li>
<li>Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)</li>
<li>Added icon for Pop! OS to picker (thanks @conath)</li>
<li>Fixed QEMU custom argument parsing when there is quoted space in middle of the argument (#3579)</li>
<li>Update the VM screenshot on a timer (#3499)</li>
<li>Added new global setting to disable saving screenshot to disk</li>
<li>Improved synchronization of state from the VM window and the main window (play button visible when stopped, busy spinner visible when starting, etc)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fix crash while installing on older versions of jailbroken iOS (#3543)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix an issue where Apple VM aux storage was not created when switching from Linux to macOS boot option</li>
<li>(macOS) Ability to move a .utm VM to external storage</li>
<li>(macOS) Toolbar option to delete VM should be disabled when VM is running</li>
<li>(macOS) Support taking screenshots of Apple VMs</li>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wizard redesign (thanks @js-john)</li>
<li>Store .utm bundles anywhere on disk (including on external drives) and import them as a shortcut. See notes below for some limitations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) <strong>UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.</strong> If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.</li>
<li>This update makes significant changes to the backend of UTM which may have introduced more issues than usual. As a precaution, please make sure you back up your VMs before running this beta in case there are bugs that cause data loss.</li>
<li>You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting &quot;Move...&quot; Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using &quot;File -&gt; Import Virtual Machine...&quot; Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is <em>always</em> deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)</li>
<li>Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.</li>
<li>Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations</li>
<li>Show &quot;unavailable&quot; VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)</li>
<li>Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)</li>
<li>Rename &quot;import&quot; menu to &quot;open&quot; to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the &quot;open&quot; option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it</li>
<li>New context menu option &quot;New from template...&quot; can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)</li>
<li>Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in &quot;busy&quot; state</li>
<li>Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when &quot;legacy input&quot; is off. Renamed &quot;legacy input&quot; to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)</li>
<li>Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed launching on &lt; iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)</li>
<li>Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -&gt; Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)</li>
<li>(iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)</li>
<li>(iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)</li>
<li>(macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)</li>
<li>Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues</li>
<li>Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)</li>
<li>(iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14</li>
<li>(iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows</li>
<li>(iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation</li>
<li>(iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)</li>
<li>(iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)</li>
<li>(macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.1.0)</h2>

                <div class="md_view"><p><strong>Please read the release notes carefully as this is a major update from v2.x and there are some changes you need to be aware of.</strong></p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wizard for VM creation</strong>: Easily create a new VM with the correct default settings with a guided step-by-step wizard. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854</li>
<li><strong>QEMU v6.2.0</strong>: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2</li>
<li>(iOS 13+) <strong>New toolbar</strong>: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023</li>
<li>(macOS 12+, ARM64) <strong>Virtualize macOS 12</strong>: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS installer directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)</li>
<li>(macOS 11+) <strong>Virtualize Linux with Apple backend</strong>: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from <code>cortex-a72</code> to <code>default</code>. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the <code>cortex-a72</code> CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). <code>default</code> will use the <code>host</code> CPU model when virtualization is used and <code>cortex-a72</code> when emulation is used.</li>
<li>The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is <strong>not</strong> marked as &quot;GPU Supported&quot;.</li>
<li>The cursor and resolution change issues on ARM64 Windows has been fixed in <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/support/">SPICE tools 0.164.3</a>. If you are using an older version and experience such issues, please update to the latest SPICE tools.</li>
<li>If you manually added <code>virtualization=on</code> to your VM machine properties, you should remove it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.0.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Introduced option to disable RNG device, which causes issues on FreeBSD (#3493)</li>
<li>Wizard: directory sharing is now enabled by default</li>
<li>Changed the default USB 3.0 controller from <code>qemu-xhci</code> to <code>nec-usb-xhci</code> which addresses an issue where the DVD drive disconnects randomly on Windows ARM64 and causes random errors during setup (#3194)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed save panel opening when you try to close the settings (#3494)</li>
<li>(macOS) Hide unsupported directory sharing options in macOS guests (#3496)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix invert scrolling option (thanks @ktprograms) (#3497)</li>
<li>(macOS) Apple VM config files are now in plain-text (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>(macOS) Hide non-disk drives from the drives icon menu and properly describe the &quot;EFI Variables&quot; &quot;drive&quot; in settings</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed suspend save state being broken in a previous update</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed a crash when a toolbar icon is hidden due to small window size and a toolbar option is selected from the menu</li>
<li>(macOS) The stop button in the main window will now stop the VM if it is started</li>
<li>(iOS) Wizard: Fix disabled button colour being the same as enabled buttons</li>
<li>(iOS) Moved the toolbar icon lower to not collide with the touch target for showing control center</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed an issue where settings are not shown if the context menu is used to open it (#3513)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.0.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to download UI (thanks @conath) (#3432)</li>
<li>Wizard: various improvements to creating Linux VMs (#3472)</li>
<li>(iOS) Add licensing text to app settings (#3236)</li>
<li>(macOS) DMG package now has a pretty icon and background (#3257)</li>
<li>(macOS) Add new preference to terminate when all windows are closed (previously this was the default) (#3483)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix custom icon for Apple VMs (#3477)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix retina mode support for QEMU VMs (note that previously there was a global preference to enable retina mode that is now removed, per-VM setting should be used instead) (#3471)</li>
<li>(macOS) Remove QEMU VM setting for &quot;Fit to Screen&quot; as it was never implemented for macOS</li>
<li>~~(macOS) Remove Apple VM setting for &quot;Retina (HiDPI) Mode&quot; as it was confusing and is not used for rendering (it just specifies the size of the virtual monitor)~~ This has been reverted in v3.0.4 and the Retina (HiDPI) Mode has been added back. A use for this feature is if you wish to take screenshots at specific resolutions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.0.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(macOS) Fixed drive delete/move buttons not appearing on macOS 11 (#3461)</li>
<li>(macOS) Added missing network entitlement for bridged networking on Apple VMs</li>
<li>(macOS) Wizard: convert VHDX to QCOW2 when creating a Windows VM</li>
<li>(macOS) Any imported drive on an interface that is NOT floppy, pflash, or none will be converted to QCOW2. This does not apply to removable drives.</li>
<li>(iOS) Improved toolbar visibility and dimming while idle behaviour</li>
<li>Wizard: skip drive creation if rootfs image is selected</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where an imported drive does not use the selected interface</li>
</ul>

<li>(iOS) Fixed crash on VM launch on &lt; iOS 13 due to toolbar not being initialized</li>
<li>(iOS) Version information will now be shown in the system Settings app for UTM (at the bottom)</li>
<li>Fixed cursor and screen resolution issues on ARM64 Windows after installing SPICE tools. Requires updating SPICE tools to <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/support/">latest version</a>.</li>
<li>Add virtio-rng-pci device to fix boot warning about randomness source (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Default upscaling mode is now &quot;nearest neighbor&quot;</li>
<li>Fixed floppy drives being read-only (thanks @conath) (#3333)</li>
<li>Wizard: no longer use NVMe for Windows on x86_64 systems</li>
<li>Fixed a regression where Windows boots into BSOD often on x86_64 virtualization</li>

<li><strong>QEMU v6.2.0</strong>: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2</li>
<li>(iOS 13+) <strong>New toolbar</strong>: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023</li>
<li>(macOS 12+, ARM64) <strong>Virtualize macOS 12</strong>: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS IPSW directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)</li>
<li>(macOS 11+) <strong>Virtualize Linux with Apple backend</strong>: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.</li>

<ul>
<li>The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from <code>cortex-a72</code> to <code>default</code>. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the <code>cortex-a72</code> CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). <code>default</code> will use the <code>host</code> CPU model when virtualization is used and <code>cortex-a72</code> when emulation is used.</li>
<li>The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is <strong>not</strong> marked as &quot;GPU Supported&quot;.</li>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><strong>Note that some changes require updates to your VM configuration so please read this part carefully.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cursor disappearing on Windows 10/11 has been fixed with an updated VirtIO GPU driver. Additionally, dynamic resolution (auto-change resolution when VM window is resized) and more fixed resolutions (matching all the screen resolutions of the latest Mac computers) were added to the driver. This requires you to download the latest SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ and run the installer again (or manually updating your GPU driver from the ISO if you know how).</li>
<li>In v2.4.0, newly created Q35 and PC machine (x86 and x86_64) defaulted to the <code>Skylake-Client</code> CPU model. Subsequently, it was discovered that the change caused performance regressions. v2.4.1 reverted the default CPU model to <code>Default</code> but if you created a new Q35/PC VM in v2.4.0, it is recommended that you manually change the CPU in System settings to <code>Default</code>.</li>
<li>Since v1.0.0, UTM used the RTL8139 network card as the default for Q35 VMs (x86 and x86_64) and Virt VMs (ARM64). There is a bug in the device implementation that causes the Windows driver to freeze the system and many users reported Windows Installer freezing as well as random freezes through normal use. In v2.4.0, we changed the default network card for Virt machines to <code>virtio-net-pci</code> and in v2.4.1, we changed the default network card for Q35 machines to E1000. However, this change only applies to newly created VMs, and any existing VMs may still suffer from the random freeze issues. It is recommended that you change your network card to <code>e1000</code> for Q35 machines and <code>virtio-net-pci</code> for Virt machines. Windows 7 and above should have the Intel E1000 network card drivers already installed, but the VirtIO Network card requires drivers in the SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ (if you previously installed this, you should have the drivers already on your system).</li>
<li>(macOS) Since v2.1.2, UTM provided an option (Cmd+,) to &quot;Use only performance cores by default&quot; which defaulted to off. When on, any VM which does not have a manually configured CPU count (&gt; 0) will set the CPU count to the number of performance cores on the system. In v2.4.1, we have made this option on by default which means if you previously have not modified this option, then it will now be on. If you turned the option on, it should not change and if you turned the option on and later off again, it should still be off. The reason for this change was because users may not be aware of this option which can result in degraded performance when left off and we believe the default should reflect the best possible performance. Note that as before, if you manually set a VM's CPU count &gt; 0, then this option does not change anything.</li>

                <h4>2.2.4</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.</p>
<h2>New Features (Summary)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(macOS 11.3+ Only) <strong>Bridged networking and shared networking support</strong>. You can configure it in the Network settings for your VM.</li>
<li>(macOS 11+ and iOS 13+) <strong>GPU acceleration for OpenGL on Linux</strong>. Use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration. Note that newly created VMs will default to a &quot;GPU Supported&quot; display device on supported architectures but existing VMs must manually change the display device in Display settings. GPU acceleration is still an experimental feature, so it may not work in some situations (including many 3D use cases).</li>
<li><strong>EFI Boot</strong>. By default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced Configuration -&gt; UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs). Note that if you've configured a custom pflash device for your VM, the new UEFI Boot option will take no effect (same as before).</li>
<li><strong>QEMU v6.1.0</strong> is now used for the backend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix crash when setting custom VM icon (#2387) (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Disable Port Forwarding feature for bridged networking (thanks @conath)</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak (#2720)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) Enable OpenGL acceleration for iOS 11-12</li>
<li>(iOS 15+) Increased memory limit for supported devices (M1 iPads currently)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey (#2644)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix capturing of hotkeys (such as Cmd+Tab) (#2677)</li>
<li>Disable port forwarding options for shared &amp; bridged networking</li>
<li>Fixed crash when PPC screamer is selected on iOS (currently this is still not supported)</li>
<li>Refactored non-OpenGL rendering code, fixing some random crashes seen in TestFlight reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) When a mouse/trackpad is already connected when UTM starts up, it will now be properly detected (#3013)</li>
<li>(iOS) Handle touch and Apple Pencil input while the mouse is captured (#2669)</li>
<li>Windows BSOD on boot/setup due to <code>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</code> (#2721)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(macOS) Settings no longer crash when an error occurs while saving a new VM</li>
<li>(iOS) GL rendering now works on EFI startup (black screen during boot) (#3076)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>v2.2.4 is built with Xcode 12.5.1 instead of Xcode 13.0 beta due to Apple's strict requirements in submitting apps built on beta SDKs. As a result, the layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey are back in v2.2.4. This will be resolved when Xcode 13 is released.</li>
<li>Networking can be broken in some instances, we are still investigating the cause. (#3051, #3094)</li>

<li>Windows BSOD on boot/setup due to <code>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</code> (#2721)</li>
<li>EFI Boot is now a configurable option: by default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced Configuration -&gt; UEFI Boot.

Note that if you've configured a custom pflash device for your VM, the new UEFI Boot option will take no effect (same as before).</li>
<li>Added <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> device to support GPU Acceleration. On previous beta builds, GL is enabled automatically for <code>virtio-ramfb</code>. Now, that display device will <strong>not</strong> get GPU acceleration. This is to be more consistent with the other <code>-gl</code> display devices. By default, new VMs created will have <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> selected for <code>virt</code> devices (ARM) and <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> selected for <code>q35</code> and <code>pc</code> devices (x86). If you wish to use GPU acceleration on an existing VM, you need to change your display device to one of these two recommended devices (or any device with <code>-gl</code> in the name).</li>
