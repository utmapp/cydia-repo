                <p><p>UTM is a full featured virtual machine host for iOS. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Android, and more on your iPhone and iPad. More information at <a href="https://getutm.app/">https://getutm.app/</a></p>
<p>This package <strong>requires</strong> AppSync Unified from Karen's Repo. Make sure to add <a href="cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/">https://cydia.akemi.ai/</a> to your repository list before installing!</p>
<p><strong>Note upgrading from &lt; v2.0.22:</strong> The old version of this package installs UTM to /Applications (just like other jailbreak apps). This was an issue because UTM uses sandboxed features and was partially broken when installed that way. Since AppSync Unified was released for iOS 14, UTM now installs the sandboxed IPA directly and as a result your old VMs will not be visible. If you had an older version installed, you need to move your VMs from <code>/var/mobile/Documents</code> to a temporary location and then open it from the built-in Files app to import it into the UTM sandbox location. Then, you can delete the old files.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V thanks to QEMU as a backend</li>
<li>Fast native graphics through para-virtualization thanks to SPICE</li>
<li>JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG</li>
<li>Frontend designed from scratch for iOS11+ using the latest and greatest APIs</li>
<li>Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to keep your VMs, make sure to back them up before uninstalling.</li>
<li>Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not). To be safe, make sure you never allocate more storage to a VM than the amount of free space you have.</li>
</ul>

                <h4>2.1.1</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p>This release brings two major features:</p>
<p>USB support is here for macOS <em>and</em> jailbroken iOS. You can attach a device to your VM with the new USB icon in the toolbar. You can enable USB 3.0 in the Share settings for faster devices on supported targets. Note that older versions of Windows (e.g. Windows 7 and below) require installing additional drivers for USB 3.0.</p>
<p>UTM SE is a new build for iOS that does not require JIT (and therefore is much slower). It can therefore be sideloaded on any iOS device that is not jailbroken. Jailbreak users are still recommended to install the standard UTM DEB package for faster JIT speeds and USB support.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.</p>
<h2>Changes (v2.1.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) Fix USB attach on (jailbroken) iOS 14.6</li>
<li>Fixed slow UEFI boot due to accidentally including a debug build of EDK2</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed captured mouse not being released when VM is shut down or suspended</li>
<li>(macOS) Trackpad scroll speed made more consistent (#2400)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed Windows 10 not booting on M1 Macs (#2546)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed Screamer audio (#2548) Note that you must now select the 'screamer' audio card for the 'mac99' system target for sound to work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.1.0)</h2>
<ul>
<li>QEMU updated from v5.2.0 to v6.0.0</li>
<li>USB support: attach a USB device to the VM (macOS and jailbroken iOS 14.5 and below only)</li>
<li>UTM SE (Slow Edition): JITless iOS build available to sideload on <em>any</em> non-jailbroken device (thanks @ktemkin)</li>
<li>Screamer audio device for PPC mac99 machines</li>

<h2>macOS Sandbox Migration</h2>
<p>If you are updating from &lt; 2.0.17 on macOS, then when you open UTM you will not see any VMs you previously created! To fix this, move your .utm files from <code>~/Documents</code> to <code>~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents</code>. You can do it in Terminal with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mv ~/Documents/*.utm ~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents
</code></pre>
<p>or with Finder</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Finder and go to your home directory.</li>
<li>Press Cmd+Shift+. (that's the period key) to show hidden files.</li>
<li>Browse to Library -&gt; Containers -&gt; UTM -&gt; Data -&gt; Documents</li>
<li>Copy or move your .utm files from your home's Documents directory to this directory.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Black screen or crash trying to start any VM? Make sure you read <strong>all</strong> the instructions in the <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">install page</a>.</li>
<li>Cannot import any drives/ISO: there is a bug in iOS where an invalid "application-identifier" entitlement causes the file picker to not work. A fix for iOS App Signer is <a href="https://github.com/DanTheMan827/ios-app-signer/pull/163">submitted</a> and can be manually compiled. If you are using AltStore, you need use a free (not paid) developer account.</li>
<li>When installed via Cydia/Sileo, Settings and Files integration does not work and VMs are not deleted automatically when uninstalled.</li>

<h2>Notice for upcoming iOS update</h2>
<p>iOS 14.4 beta 2 broke JIT again (for non-jailbroken A12+ devices), and likely for good this time. We do not recommend updating to iOS 14.4 when it is released to the public.</p>
<h2>macOS Sandbox Migration</h2>
<p>If you are updating from &lt; 2.0.17 on macOS, then when you open UTM you will not see any VMs you previously created! To fix this, move your .utm files from <code>~/Documents</code> to <code>~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents</code>. You can do it in Terminal with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mv ~/Documents/*.utm ~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents
</code></pre>
<p>or with Finder</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Finder and go to your home directory.</li>
<li>Press Cmd+Shift+. (that's the period key) to show hidden files.</li>

<li>Default clipboard sharing setting to on for 'pc' and 'virt' targets on new VMs (SPICE tools still required)</li>
<li>(macOS) Default hypervisor to on. Note: this overrides any previous setting due to confusion caused by a bug in the last release where the settings dialog shows hypervisor on while it is actually off. This also changes the wording of the setting so checking the box now <em>disables</em> hypervisor. This is to align with the idea that default = off position in the settings.</li>

                <h4>2.0.10</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p>UTM 2.0 includes a redesign of the frontend for iOS 14 and introduces support for macOS 11. Due API limitations, the new design will <strong>not</strong> be available for iOS 13 and below. That means any feature that depends on the new design will also <strong>not</strong> be back-ported to iOS 13. Launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 14 will show the new design and launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 13 and below will show the old design. UTM 2.0 also updates the QEMU backend from 4.2.0 to 5.1.0 (for all supported iOS versions).</p>
<p>Installation instructions differ depending on what version of iOS you are running:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 11-13: You can install and run UTM using any version of AltStore (recommended) or <a href="https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/">iOS App Signer</a>.</li>
<li>iOS 14: You must either be jailbroken or follow the <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/blob/master/Documentation/TetheredLaunch.md">tethered launch</a> instructions every time you launch UTM. Note that the jailbroken instructions are currently outdated. If you have a good guide, please let us <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/537">know</a>.</li>
<li>iOS 14.2: You can use either the beta AltStore (1.4.2) or <a href="https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/">iOS App Signer</a>. Note A11 and older devices are not supported by this method and must be jailbroken or use tethered launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, please report all bugs to <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues">Github</a></p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS 14, macOS): Fixed an issue with the welcome screen not updated for dark mode</li>
<li>(iOS 14, macOS): Add back the option to specify boot device order.</li>
<li>(macOS): Fix context menu not showing on right click on the sidebar</li>
<li>(macOS): Fix play button not working on the sidebar</li>
<li>(macOS): Sign release to prevent "damaged and cannot be opened" error</li>
<li>(macOS): Hardened runtime and notarization to prevent gatekeeper issues and "internal error" on startup</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cannot import any drives/ISO: there is a bug in iOS where an invalid "application-identifier" entitlement causes the file picker to not work. A fix for iOS App Signer is <a href="https://github.com/DanTheMan827/ios-app-signer/pull/163">submitted</a> and can be manually compiled.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>AltStore cannot install UTM on iOS 14: make sure you are running AltStore 1.4.2 or higher. At time of writing, 1.4.2 beta is only available to AltStore Patreon beta testers. For those without access, you can use <a href="https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/">iOS App Signer</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Notice to users of previous versions: If you are running an older version of UTM (v1 or v2 beta), please note that because the bundle identifier has changed, it will install as a new app and AltStore will not show an update for your existing app. You should manually move your VMs to the new app. We are also retiring the distinction of beta vs release. Since we don't have dedicated testers or a QA team, it is misleading to label something as 'beta' or 'release' when every build incrementally improves upon the last one.</p>
<p>As always, please report all bugs to <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues">Github</a></p>
<p>One more thing... macOS 11 universal builds will now be included in the releases. Be warned that currently the macOS builds are still very unstable.</p>
<h2>Changes (from last update)</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Changes (highlights since v1.0)</h2>

<p>iOS 14 unfortunately patched the ptrace() exploit that allowed UTM to run side-loaded on non-jailbroken devices. However, iOS 14.2 introduces a new method for running UTM's JIT engine (untethered). As of this release, the changes to AltStore required for the new method are not released yet, so for now the recommended way to install UTM for iOS 14.2 is <strong>not</strong> to use AltStore. You should use <a href="https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/">iOS App Signer</a> until the new AltStore is released.</p>

<li>Implemented APRR JIT for &lt; iOS 14. This means non-jailbroken devices on &lt; iOS 13.5 (thanks to Psychic Paper) and ALL jailbroken devices get improved JIT. These devices no longer have the 1/2 JIT cache penalty (and can allocate a bit more guest RAM).
