                <p><p>UTM is a full featured virtual machine host for iOS. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Android, and more on your iPhone and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/</p>
<p>This package <strong>requires</strong> AppSync Unified from Karen's Repo. Make sure to add <a href="cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/">https://cydia.akemi.ai/</a> to your repository list before installing!</p>
<p><strong>Note upgrading from &lt; v2.0.22:</strong> The old version of this package installs UTM to /Applications (just like other jailbreak apps). This was an issue because UTM uses sandboxed features and was partially broken when installed that way. Since AppSync Unified was released for iOS 14, UTM now installs the sandboxed IPA directly and as a result your old VMs will not be visible. If you had an older version installed, you need to move your VMs from <code>/var/mobile/Documents</code> to a temporary location and then open it from the built-in Files app to import it into the UTM sandbox location. Then, you can delete the old files.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V thanks to QEMU as a backend</li>
<li>Fast native graphics through para-virtualization thanks to SPICE</li>
<li>JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG</li>
<li>Frontend designed from scratch for iOS11+ using the latest and greatest APIs</li>
<li>Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to keep your VMs, make sure to back them up before uninstalling.</li>
<li>Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not). To be safe, make sure you never allocate more storage to a VM than the amount of free space you have.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wizard for VM creation</strong>: Easily create a new VM with the correct default settings with a guided step-by-step wizard. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854</li>
<li><strong>QEMU v6.2.0</strong>: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2</li>
<li>(iOS 13+) <strong>New toolbar</strong>: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023</li>
<li>(macOS 12+, ARM64) <strong>Virtualize macOS 12</strong>: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS IPSW directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)</li>
<li>(macOS 11+) <strong>Virtualize Linux with Apple backend</strong>: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from <code>cortex-a72</code> to <code>default</code>. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the <code>cortex-a72</code> CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). <code>default</code> will use the <code>host</code> CPU model when virtualization is used and <code>cortex-a72</code> when emulation is used.</li>
<li>The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is <strong>not</strong> marked as &quot;GPU Supported&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v3.0.0)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added VM creation wizard</li>
<li>Updated QEMU to v6.2.0</li>
<li>Updated ANGLE to latest commit</li>
<li>Updated virglrenderer to latest commit (this may fix #2743)</li>
<li>Added <code>default</code> and <code>host</code> CPU option for ARM64 virtual machines. This will be the default for newly created VMs.</li>
<li>The downloader will no longer perform CRC checks on the ZIP file and this will significantly speed up extraction.</li>
<li>(iOS 13+) Redesigned toolbar (#496)</li>
<li>(macOS) Redesigned VM settings</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix crash moving drives (#3117)</li>
<li>(macOS) Make HVF per-VM configurable (#2493)</li>
<li>(macOS) Add Apple Virtualization.framework backend</li>
<li>(macOS) New Terminal frontend with SwiftTerm, currently only used with Apple backend on macOS</li>
<li>(macOS) Apple Virtualization supports virtual serial port through PTY device</li>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><strong>Note that some changes require updates to your VM configuration so please read this part carefully.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cursor disappearing on Windows 10/11 has been fixed with an updated VirtIO GPU driver. Additionally, dynamic resolution (auto-change resolution when VM window is resized) and more fixed resolutions (matching all the screen resolutions of the latest Mac computers) were added to the driver. This requires you to download the latest SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ and run the installer again (or manually updating your GPU driver from the ISO if you know how).</li>
<li>In v2.4.0, newly created Q35 and PC machine (x86 and x86_64) defaulted to the <code>Skylake-Client</code> CPU model. Subsequently, it was discovered that the change caused performance regressions. v2.4.1 reverted the default CPU model to <code>Default</code> but if you created a new Q35/PC VM in v2.4.0, it is recommended that you manually change the CPU in System settings to <code>Default</code>.</li>
<li>Since v1.0.0, UTM used the RTL8139 network card as the default for Q35 VMs (x86 and x86_64) and Virt VMs (ARM64). There is a bug in the device implementation that causes the Windows driver to freeze the system and many users reported Windows Installer freezing as well as random freezes through normal use. In v2.4.0, we changed the default network card for Virt machines to <code>virtio-net-pci</code> and in v2.4.1, we changed the default network card for Q35 machines to E1000. However, this change only applies to newly created VMs, and any existing VMs may still suffer from the random freeze issues. It is recommended that you change your network card to <code>e1000</code> for Q35 machines and <code>virtio-net-pci</code> for Virt machines. Windows 7 and above should have the Intel E1000 network card drivers already installed, but the VirtIO Network card requires drivers in the SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ (if you previously installed this, you should have the drivers already on your system).</li>
<li>(macOS) Since v2.1.2, UTM provided an option (Cmd+,) to &quot;Use only performance cores by default&quot; which defaulted to off. When on, any VM which does not have a manually configured CPU count (&gt; 0) will set the CPU count to the number of performance cores on the system. In v2.4.1, we have made this option on by default which means if you previously have not modified this option, then it will now be on. If you turned the option on, it should not change and if you turned the option on and later off again, it should still be off. The reason for this change was because users may not be aware of this option which can result in degraded performance when left off and we believe the default should reflect the best possible performance. Note that as before, if you manually set a VM's CPU count &gt; 0, then this option does not change anything.</li>

                <h4>2.2.4</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="https://getutm.app/install/">https://getutm.app/install/</a> for the most up to date installation instructions.</p>
<h2>New Features (Summary)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(macOS 11.3+ Only) <strong>Bridged networking and shared networking support</strong>. You can configure it in the Network settings for your VM.</li>
<li>(macOS 11+ and iOS 13+) <strong>GPU acceleration for OpenGL on Linux</strong>. Use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration. Note that newly created VMs will default to a &quot;GPU Supported&quot; display device on supported architectures but existing VMs must manually change the display device in Display settings. GPU acceleration is still an experimental feature, so it may not work in some situations (including many 3D use cases).</li>
<li><strong>EFI Boot</strong>. By default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced Configuration -&gt; UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs). Note that if you've configured a custom pflash device for your VM, the new UEFI Boot option will take no effect (same as before).</li>
<li><strong>QEMU v6.1.0</strong> is now used for the backend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix crash when setting custom VM icon (#2387) (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Disable Port Forwarding feature for bridged networking (thanks @conath)</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak (#2720)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) Enable OpenGL acceleration for iOS 11-12</li>
<li>(iOS 15+) Increased memory limit for supported devices (M1 iPads currently)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey (#2644)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix capturing of hotkeys (such as Cmd+Tab) (#2677)</li>
<li>Disable port forwarding options for shared &amp; bridged networking</li>
<li>Fixed crash when PPC screamer is selected on iOS (currently this is still not supported)</li>
<li>Refactored non-OpenGL rendering code, fixing some random crashes seen in TestFlight reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) When a mouse/trackpad is already connected when UTM starts up, it will now be properly detected (#3013)</li>
<li>(iOS) Handle touch and Apple Pencil input while the mouse is captured (#2669)</li>
<li>Windows BSOD on boot/setup due to <code>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</code> (#2721)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(macOS) Settings no longer crash when an error occurs while saving a new VM</li>
<li>(iOS) GL rendering now works on EFI startup (black screen during boot) (#3076)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>v2.2.4 is built with Xcode 12.5.1 instead of Xcode 13.0 beta due to Apple's strict requirements in submitting apps built on beta SDKs. As a result, the layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey are back in v2.2.4. This will be resolved when Xcode 13 is released.</li>
<li>Networking can be broken in some instances, we are still investigating the cause. (#3051, #3094)</li>

<li>(macOS 11.3+ Only) <strong>Bridged networking and shared networking support</strong>. You can configure it in the Network settings for your VM.</li>
<li>(macOS 11+ and iOS 13+) <strong>GPU acceleration for OpenGL on Linux</strong>. Use <code>virtio-ramfb</code> or <code>virtio-gpu-gl-pci</code> display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) Enable OpenGL acceleration for iOS 11-12</li>
<li>(iOS 15+) Increased memory limit for supported devices (M1 iPads currently)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey (#2644)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix capturing of hotkeys (such as Cmd+Tab) (#2677)</li>
<li>Disable port forwarding options for shared &amp; bridged networking</li>
<li>Fixed crash when PPC screamer is selected on iOS (currently this is still not supported)</li>
<li>Refactored non-OpenGL rendering code, fixing some random crashes seen in TestFlight reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS) When a mouse/trackpad is already connected when UTM starts up, it will now be properly detected (#3013)</li>
<li>(iOS) Handle touch and Apple Pencil input while the mouse is captured (#2669)</li>
<li>Windows BSOD on boot/setup due to <code>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</code> (#2721)</li>
<li>EFI Boot is now a configurable option: by default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced Configuration -&gt; UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs). Note that if you've configured a custom pflash device for your VM, the new UEFI Boot option will take no effect (same as before).</li>
<li>Added <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> device to support GPU Acceleration. On previous beta builds, GL is enabled automatically for <code>virtio-ramfb</code>. Now, that display device will <strong>not</strong> get GPU acceleration. This is to be more consistent with the other <code>-gl</code> display devices. By default, new VMs created will have <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> selected for <code>virt</code> devices (ARM) and <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> selected for <code>q35</code> and <code>pc</code> devices (x86). If you wish to use GPU acceleration on an existing VM, you need to change your display device to one of these two recommended devices (or any device with <code>-gl</code> in the name).</li>

</ul>
<h2>Changes (v2.2.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>GPU acceleration is now using <strong>OpenGL</strong> instead of <strong>Metal</strong> due to compatibility issues. Please report anything that works on v2.2.0 (Metal) but fails on v2.2.1 (OpenGL). If there are many cases of these, then we will add an option to switch between the two backends. From experience though, it seems like the OpenGL backend is more stable and more compatible. However, compatibility is not perfect and you may experience crashes when trying to launch an unsupported app in the guest. As before, GPU acceleration only works on Linux with the correct Mesa drivers installed for virtio.</li>
<li>QEMU is updated to v6.1.0 (release)</li>
<li>Fix crash when setting custom VM icon (#2387) (thanks @ktprograms)</li>
<li>Disable Port Forwarding feature for bridged networking (thanks @conath)</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak (#2720)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>On Intel Macs, <code>virtio-ramfb</code> and <code>virtio-gpu-pl-pci</code> does not work with BIOS boot. You need to boot from UEFI which currently requires you to manually add a PC Flash device with the UEFI image. In the future, there will be an option to boot from UEFI instead of BIOS.</li>
<li>On macOS 12, some UI elements are laid out incorrectly due to changes in SwiftUI apis.</li>

                <div class="md_view"><p>This release brings two major features:</p>
<p>USB support is here for macOS <em>and</em> jailbroken iOS. You can attach a device to your VM with the new USB icon in the toolbar. You can enable USB 3.0 in the Share settings for faster devices on supported targets. Note that older versions of Windows (e.g. Windows 7 and below) require installing additional drivers for USB 3.0.</p>
<p>UTM SE is a new build for iOS that does not require JIT (and therefore is much slower). It can therefore be sideloaded on any iOS device that is not jailbroken. Jailbreak users are still recommended to install the standard UTM DEB package for faster JIT speeds and USB support.</p>

<h2>Notice for iOS 14.4</h2>
<p>iOS 14.4 broke JIT again (for non-jailbroken A12+ devices), and likely for good this time. We do not recommend updating to iOS 14.4. Future support for iOS will be limited to jailbroken devices only.</p>
<h2>macOS Sandbox Migration</h2>
<p>If you are updating from &lt; 2.0.17 on macOS, then when you open UTM you will not see any VMs you previously created! To fix this, move your .utm files from <code>~/Documents</code> to <code>~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents</code>. You can do it in Terminal with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mv ~/Documents/*.utm ~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents
</code></pre>
<p>or with Finder</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Finder and go to your home directory.</li>
<li>Press Cmd+Shift+. (that's the period key) to show hidden files.</li>
<li>Browse to Library -&gt; Containers -&gt; UTM -&gt; Data -&gt; Documents</li>
<li>Copy or move your .utm files from your home's Documents directory to this directory.</li>

<li>Starting a VM goes to a black screen on iOS 14: you need to sign UTM with a &quot;development&quot; certificate. If you used a 3rd party signing service, it is probably signed with the wrong certificate. If you signed UTM yourself, make sure you chose a &quot;development&quot; certificate and in iOS App Signer, &quot;No get-task-allow&quot; is unchecked.</li>
</ul>
