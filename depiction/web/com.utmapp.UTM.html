                <p><p>UTM is a full featured virtual machine host for iOS. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Android, and more on your iPhone and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/</p>
<p>This package <strong>requires</strong> AppSync Unified from Karen's Repo. Make sure to add <a href="cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/">https://cydia.akemi.ai/</a> to your repository list before installing!</p>
<p><strong>Note upgrading from &lt; v2.0.22:</strong> The old version of this package installs UTM to /Applications (just like other jailbreak apps). This was an issue because UTM uses sandboxed features and was partially broken when installed that way. Since AppSync Unified was released for iOS 14, UTM now installs the sandboxed IPA directly and as a result your old VMs will not be visible. If you had an older version installed, you need to move your VMs from <code>/var/mobile/Documents</code> to a temporary location and then open it from the built-in Files app to import it into the UTM sandbox location. Then, you can delete the old files.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V thanks to QEMU as a backend</li>
<li>Fast native graphics through para-virtualization thanks to SPICE</li>
<li>JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG</li>
<li>Frontend designed from scratch for iOS11+ using the latest and greatest APIs</li>
<li>Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to keep your VMs, make sure to back them up before uninstalling.</li>
<li>Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not). To be safe, make sure you never allocate more storage to a VM than the amount of free space you have.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>(macOS) <strong>UTM Remote server for macOS</strong> On macOS 13+, you can enable UTM Server from the new option on the home screen or from Window -&gt; UTM Server. Once enabled, you can stream QEMU backend VMs to supported clients. The preferences page includes additional options including auto-starting the server and allowing external connections so it can be used outside of the local network. New documentation pages will be added in the future.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>UTM Remote client for iOS and visionOS</strong> When UTM Server is enabled on macOS, you can connect to it with the new UTM Remote client which uses the same frontend as UTM for iOS/visionOS but without any of the QEMU backend. You can get it for free on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-remote-virtual-machines/id6470773592">App Store</a>.</li>
<li>(iOS) UTM SE's wizard now allow you to create a VM easily with a floppy boot image.</li>

<li><strong>UTM Remote client for iOS and visionOS</strong> When UTM Server is enabled on macOS, you can connect to it with the new UTM Remote client which uses the same frontend as UTM for iOS/visionOS but without any of the QEMU backend. TestFlight will be available as soon as it is approved and the plans are to release it as a free app in the App Store.</li>

                <h4>4.4.5</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p><strong>macOS Users:</strong> there is no difference between v4.4.4 and v4.4.5. You do not need to update.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>macOS Sonoma support</strong> New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.</li>
<li><strong>Automatically save state when you close a VM</strong> This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>USB commands in utmctl</strong> You can now use <code>utmctl usb</code> commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore support for newer iOS</strong> With the release of <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore 2</a>, this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple <a href="http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986">removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4</a>. The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -&gt; QEMU -&gt; Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.</li>
<li>(macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.</li>
<li>Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error <code>GL_ARB_clear_texture</code>. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.</li>
<li>Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select &quot;Install Windows Guest Tools&quot;. This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.</li>

                <h4>4.4.3</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>macOS Sonoma support</strong> New Apple Virtualization features include save/restore VM state and dynamic resolution for macOS Sonoma guests. Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.</li>
<li><strong>visionOS support</strong> UTM is now working on visionOS but until we get our hands on a real device, it is TBD on how to actually run it. If you are a lucky owner of a development unit, you can try it out yourself with the provided IPAs.</li>
<li><strong>Automatically save state when you close a VM</strong> This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>USB commands in utmctl</strong> You can now use <code>utmctl usb</code> commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -&gt; QEMU -&gt; Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.</li>
<li>(macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.</li>
<li>Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error <code>GL_ARB_clear_texture</code>. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.4.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Guest Tools: supports caching the latest version and will only re-download when a newer version is available (#5692)</li>

<li>Localization: Updated Russian (thanks @s0rd3s)</li>
<li>(visionOS) Fixed display scaling sometimes not applying</li>
<li>(visionOS) Reimplemented multiple-window support with newer APIs and fixes an issue where the main window is resized on startup to the last VM display size</li>
<li>(visionOS) Process gaze touch events as indirect input</li>
<li>(visionOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard button was not opening the keyboard and sometimes causes the keyboard to keep popping up after being closed</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue where <code>efi_vars.fd</code> is locked when the QEMU process deadlocks (#5769)</li>
</ul>

                <h4>4.3.5</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rewrite of QEMU support internals.</strong> Much of the code to support QEMU has been refactored into a new project, <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit">QEMUKit</a>, which will make it easier to support QEMU changes as well as support for new platforms.</li>
<li><strong>TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot</strong> This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select &quot;UEFI Boot&quot;, &quot;TPM 2.0 Device&quot;, and &quot;Reset UEFI Variables.&quot; Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.</li>
<li><strong>Download Windows installer with a new utility.</strong> We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch">GitHub</a> as well as free on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289">Mac App Store</a>. This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU → QEMU Machine Properties, add the text <code>hpet=on</code>.</li>
<li>In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.</li>
<li>If you suspended an Apple Virtualization VM in v4.4 and then downgrade to v4.3, you will not be able to resume the VM or start it at all. Please make sure you shut down any such VMs before downgrading or you may suffer data loss.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0</li>
<li>Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102</li>
<li>Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked</li>
<li>(macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)</li>
<li>Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)</li>
<li>(macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If &quot;Enable Debug Log&quot; is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows &quot;port not connected&quot; when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)</li>
<li>(macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)</li>
<li>(macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)</li>
<li>(macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)</li>
<li>Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly</li>
<li>QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)</li>
<li>EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)</li>
<li>utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)</li>
<li>Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)</li>
<li>Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected</li>
<li>(macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.</li>
<li>Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.</li>
<li>Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved</li>
<li>Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)</li>
<li>Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters</li>
<li>Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation</li>
<li>Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.</li>
<li>Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release</li>
<li>Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1</li>
<li>If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS. (#5419)</li>
<li>Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed an issue where TSO setting was not saved</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue where every time a VM is started with a terminal window, the width of the window gets a bit larger</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue where starting a stopped VM does not change the display scale</li>
<li>(macOS) AVM: System keys will be captured automatically when entering full screen and released when exiting full screen (#3668)</li>
<li>(macOS) AVM: Fixed the request stop method in both the GUI and scripting interfaces (#5425)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.2</li>
<li>Refactored QEMU support to a new project: <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit">QEMUKit</a></li>
<li>Machines with IDE interface (i44FX/PIIX) will now support two units per bus. Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will <em>not</em> get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the “Update Interface” button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)</li>
<li>Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)</li>
<li>(macOS) New option “Automatic” for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host. Both AVM and QEMU backends are supported. (#5410)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed trackpad setting not saving (#5369)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.0)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.0</li>
<li>Changed audio backend from CoreAudio back to SPICE (as it was before v4.2.x). Clarify that CoreAudio backend does not support microphone (#5253)</li>
<li>Add support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 (#5295)</li>
<li>Wizard: Properly display an error message when there is a failure writing to disk (#5271)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where ISAPC emulation target cannot be started (#5280)</li>
<li>Fixed CoreAudio being instantiated even when audio is disabled</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where legacy VMs with AC97 sound card has an empty name in settings</li>
<li>Fixed an QEMU issue where the <code>ucomiss</code> instruction causes a crash in some applications (#5294)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue preventing VMs with commas in their name from starting (note only new VMs will be fixed) (#5332)</li>
<li>(macOS) AVM: Support canceling macOS installation</li>
<li>(macOS) utmctl: Added <code>delete</code> command (#5290)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue creating a shortcut from drag &amp; drop as well as double clicking from Finder (#5310, #5311)</li>
<li>(macOS) Added DHCP start/end settings for vmnet (#5301)</li>

To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select &quot;UEFI Boot&quot;, &quot;TPM 2.0 Device&quot;, and &quot;Reset UEFI Variables.&quot; Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.</li>
<li><strong>Download Windows installer with a new utility.</strong> We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch">GitHub</a> as well as free on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289">Mac App Store</a>. This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU → QEMU Machine Properties, add the text <code>hpet=on</code>.</p>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)</li>
<li>Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly</li>
<li>QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)</li>
<li>EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)</li>
<li>utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)</li>
<li>Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)</li>
<li>Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected</li>
<li>(macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.</li>
<li>Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.</li>
<li>Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved</li>
<li>Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)</li>
<li>Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters</li>
<li>Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation</li>
<li>Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.</li>
<li>Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release</li>
<li>Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1</li>
<li>If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS. (#5419)</li>
<li>Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed an issue where TSO setting was not saved</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue where every time a VM is started with a terminal window, the width of the window gets a bit larger</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue where starting a stopped VM does not change the display scale</li>
<li>(macOS) AVM: System keys will be captured automatically when entering full screen and released when exiting full screen (#3668)</li>
<li>(macOS) AVM: Fixed the request stop method in both the GUI and scripting interfaces (#5425)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.2</li>
<li>Refactored QEMU support to a new project: <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit">QEMUKit</a></li>
<li>Machines with IDE interface (i44FX/PIIX) will now support two units per bus. Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will <em>not</em> get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the “Update Interface” button on each IDE drive in the VM settings. (#5358)</li>
<li>Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @studio1a9)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed crash when AVM window is closed (#5347)</li>
<li>(macOS) New option “Automatic” for bridged network connection which will use the bridge the first active connection on the host. Both AVM and QEMU backends are supported. (#5410)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed trackpad setting not saving (#5369)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.3.0)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.0</li>

                <h4>4.2.5</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS SE) <strong>TCTI backend updates</strong>. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Guest interface commands</strong>. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Scripting interface additions</strong>. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See <a href="https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/">this page</a> for more details and <a href="https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/">the cheat sheet</a> for example usage.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>External read-write drive images</strong>. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when &quot;read only&quot; is unchecked in the settings).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.2.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)</li>
<li>Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)</li>
<li>(macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.2.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched</li>
<li>Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an &quot;access denied&quot; error shows up on startup</li>
<li>Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)</li>
<li>Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues</li>
<li>Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.2.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to &quot;Disk&quot; and uncheck the &quot;Read Only?&quot; option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)</li>
<li>Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to &quot;Disk&quot; (#5171)</li>
<li>Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)</li>
<li>(macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)</li>

                <h4>4.2.4</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS SE) <strong>TCTI backend updates</strong>. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Guest interface commands</strong>. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>Scripting interface additions</strong>. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See <a href="https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/">this page</a> for more details and <a href="https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/">the cheat sheet</a> for example usage.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>External read-write drive images</strong>. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when &quot;read only&quot; is unchecked in the settings).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.2.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched</li>
<li>Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an &quot;access denied&quot; error shows up on startup</li>
<li>Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)</li>
<li>Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues</li>
<li>Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.2.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc). To use this feature, set the image type to &quot;Disk&quot; and uncheck the &quot;Read Only?&quot; option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)</li>
<li>Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to &quot;Disk&quot; (#5171)</li>
<li>Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)</li>
<li>(macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)</li>
<li>(macOS) CLI: Added a new <code>clone</code> command (#5004)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.2.2)</h2>

                <h4>4.1.6</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p>This is the same release as v4.1.5 but with the change to default enable GPU acceleration for Linux reverted. This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to <code>virtio-gpu-pci</code> or another card that does not have <code>-gl</code> in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0</strong>. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)</li>
<li><strong>Improved renderer backend</strong>. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT</strong>. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)</strong>. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface</strong>. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in <code>UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl</code> (which you can symlink to <code>/usr/local/bin/utmctl</code> if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.</li>
<li>(macOS 13+) <strong>Menu bar extra</strong>. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use <code>virtio-gpu-gl-pci</code> by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to <code>virtio-ramfb</code> or <code>virtio-vga</code>.~~</li>
<li>Newly created Windows VMs will now use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> (Apple Silicon) or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a <code>-gl</code> display card.</li>
<li>(iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as <code>glxgears</code> will not work with the Metal backend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.6)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for &quot;Hardware OpenGL Acceleration&quot; which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.</li>
<li>Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.</li>
<li>Newly created Windows VMs will now use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> (Apple Silicon) or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)</li>
<li>Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.</li>
<li>CLI: Improved some help text.</li>
<li>Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus</li>
<li>Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now</li>
<li>Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)</li>
<li>(iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as <code>glxgears</code> not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)</li>
<li>(macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated QEMU to v7.2.0</li>
<li>Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs</li>
<li>Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)</li>
<li>Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience</li>
<li>Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration</li>
<li>Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system</li>
<li>Fixed crash due to an error with <code>GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID</code> (#4722)</li>
<li>Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)</li>
<li>Fixed crash in <code>-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]</code> (#3519)</li>
<li>Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)</li>
<li>Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)</li>
<li>Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore build: use <code>com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox</code> instead of <code>com.apple.private.security.no-container</code> on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing &quot;Open&quot; in the wizard (#4842)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)</li>
<li>(macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings</li>

<li><strong>Improved renderer backend</strong>. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT</strong>. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.</li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)</strong>. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface</strong>. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in <code>UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl</code> (which you can symlink to <code>/usr/local/bin/utmctl</code> if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.</li>
<li>(macOS 13+) <strong>Menu bar extra</strong>. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>Newly created Linux VMs will now use <code>virtio-gpu-gl-pci</code> by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to <code>virtio-ramfb</code> or <code>virtio-vga</code>.</li>
<li>Newly created Windows VMs will now use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> (Apple Silicon) or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a <code>-gl</code> display card.</li>
<li>(iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as <code>glxgears</code> will not work with the Metal backend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.</li>
<li>Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.</li>
<li>Newly created Windows VMs will now use <code>virtio-ramfb-gl</code> (Apple Silicon) or <code>virtio-vga-gl</code> (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)</li>
<li>Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.</li>
<li>CLI: Improved some help text.</li>
<li>Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (v4.1.4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus</li>
<li>Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now</li>
<li>Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds</li>
<li>(iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)</li>
<li>(iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as <code>glxgears</code> not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)</li>
<li>(iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)</li>
<li>(macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Updated QEMU to v7.2.0</li>
<li>Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs</li>

                <h4>4.1.2</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QEMU backend updated to v7.1.0</strong></li>
<li>(iOS) <strong>TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT</strong>. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.</li>
<li>(macOS) <strong>AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface</strong>. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in <code>UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl</code> (which you can symlink to <code>/usr/local/bin/utmctl</code> if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.</li>
<li>(macOS 13+) <strong>Menu bar extra</strong>. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 14 and macOS 11.3</strong> are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11</li>
<li>The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. <strong>Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.</strong></li>
</ul>
