                <p><p>UTM is a full featured virtual machine host for iOS. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Android, and more on your iPhone and iPad. More information at <a href="https://getutm.app/">https://getutm.app/</a></p>
<p>This package <strong>requires</strong> AppSync Unified from Karen's Repo. Make sure to add <a href="cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/">https://cydia.akemi.ai/</a> to your repository list before installing!</p>
<p><strong>Note upgrading from &lt; v2.0.22:</strong> The old version of this package installs UTM to /Applications (just like other jailbreak apps). This was an issue because UTM uses sandboxed features and was partially broken when installed that way. Since AppSync Unified was released for iOS 14, UTM now installs the sandboxed IPA directly and as a result your old VMs will not be visible. If you had an older version installed, you need to move your VMs from <code>/var/mobile/Documents</code> to a temporary location and then open it from the built-in Files app to import it into the UTM sandbox location. Then, you can delete the old files.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V thanks to QEMU as a backend</li>
<li>Fast native graphics through para-virtualization thanks to SPICE</li>
<li>JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG</li>
<li>Frontend designed from scratch for iOS11+ using the latest and greatest APIs</li>
<li>Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to keep your VMs, make sure to back them up before uninstalling.</li>
<li>Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not). To be safe, make sure you never allocate more storage to a VM than the amount of free space you have.</li>
</ul>

<li>Open Finder and go to your home directory.</li>

                <div class="md_view"><p>UTM 2.0 includes a redesign of the frontend for iOS 14 and introduces support for macOS 11.

<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>QEMU updated to v5.1.0 release with v4 of @agraf's hypervisor patches for M1</li>
<li>Update Korean localization (thanks @obbcth)</li>
<li>Default clipboard sharing setting to on for 'pc' and 'virt' targets on new VMs (SPICE tools still required)</li>
<li>(macOS) Default hypervisor to on. Note: this overrides any previous setting due to confusion caused by a bug in the last release where the settings dialog shows hypervisor on while it is actually off. This also changes the wording of the setting so checking the box now <em>disables</em> hypervisor. This is to align with the idea that default = off position in the settings.</li>
<li>(macOS) Disable pause button when hypervisor is used (pausing is not supported by QEMU)</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix various issues closing+reopening a VM window</li>
<li>(macOS) Fix a crash if VM was resized and then re-opened (#1203)</li>

<li>iOS 14: You must either be jailbroken or follow the <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/blob/master/Documentation/TetheredLaunch.md">tethered launch</a> instructions every time you launch UTM.</li>
<li>iOS 14.2: You can use either the beta AltStore (1.4.2) or <a href="https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/">iOS App Signer</a>. Note some people report issues with this, please <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/516">post the device model you're running if it does not work</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice to users of previous versions: If you are running an older version of UTM (v1 or v2 beta), please note that because the bundle identifier has changed, it will install as a new app and AltStore will not show an update for your existing app. You should manually move your VMs to the new app. We are also retiring the distinction of beta vs release. Since we don't have dedicated testers or a QA team, it is misleading to label something as 'beta' or 'release' when every build incrementally improves upon the last one.</p>
<p>As always, please report all bugs to <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues">Github</a></p>
<p>One more thing... macOS 11 universal builds will now be included in the releases. Be warned that currently the macOS builds are still very unstable.</p>

                <h4>2.0b7</h4>
                <div class="md_view"><p>UTM 2.0 includes a redesign of the frontend for iOS 14 and introduces support for macOS 11. Due API limitations, the new design will <strong>not</strong> be available for iOS 13 and below. That means any feature that depends on the new design will also <strong>not</strong> be back-ported to iOS 13. Launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 14 will show the new design and launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 13 and below will show the old design.</p>
<p>iOS 14 unfortunately patched the ptrace() exploit that allowed UTM to run side-loaded on non-jailbroken devices. However, iOS 14.2 introduces a new method for running UTM's JIT engine (untethered). As of this release, the changes to AltStore required for the new method are not released yet, so for now the recommended way to install UTM for iOS 14.2 is <strong>not</strong> to use AltStore. You should use <a href="https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/">iOS App Signer</a> until the new AltStore is released.</p>
<p>As always, please report all bugs to <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues">Github</a></p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(iOS 14) Detect new iOS 14.2 JIT enable method (see above)</li>
<li>(iOS 14) Disable modifying VM settings when suspended (#476)</li>
<li>(iOS 14) When VM is suspended, add toolbar/menu option to delete save state. Also show suspended state in details view.</li>
<li>Fix QEMU issue where on some occasion, "Could not remap code buffer mirror" error shows up on launch.</li>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed “Could not allocate dynamic translator buffer” on jailbroken devices (#459)</li>
<li>Implemented APRR JIT for &lt; iOS 14. This means non-jailbroken devices on &lt; iOS 13.5 (thanks to Psychic Paper) and ALL jailbroken devices get improved JIT. These devices no longer have the 1/2 JIT cache penalty (and can allocate a bit more guest RAM). The kernel instability from improper exit should also no longer affect these devices and you can now terminate UTM by swiping up from the task switcher.</li>

<p>!!! THIS RELEASE BREAKS SOME EXISTING VMS, PLEASE READ THESE NOTES FOR MORE INFORMATION !!!</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed force drive type to "virtio" for "virt" machines (#324) NOTE: This breaks many ARM VMs that depended on this behaviour (including the official ArchLinux image). Those will boot into a black screen. To fix, you need to modify the drive and set the "Location" from "sd" (or whatever) to "virtio".</li>
<li>Display version number in config (#328)</li>
<li>A warning message is displayed when saving a suspend image is not supported (#310) NOTE: You must have a qcow2 disk image to use suspend. If you only have ISO and/or RAW images, suspend/resume will not work.</li>
<li>Removed the option to create RAW images. NOTE: this created a lot of confusion because 1) suspend/resume didn't work (see above) and 2) there is no performance benefit against "compressed" (qcow2) images. There is also an incorrect assumption that "compressed" images will auto-compress the data. That is incorrect, as it only compresses the initial data of all zeros.</li>
<li>Added an option to set machine properties manually for those who need it (#313) NOTE: Most do not need to touch this new option. It's only use right now is a workaround for mac99 VMs that need to set <code>via=pmu-adb</code> on some older versions of MacOS.</li>
<li>Added more keys to the keyboard strip including "page down" needed for installing older versions of Windows (#323)</li>
<li>Improved debug logging to save more log entries</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed on-screen keyboard broken in RC2 (#329)</li>
<li>Fixed issue where UTM attempts to resume a VM that has no suspend image (#280)</li>
<li>Fixed Ctrl+C in console mode (#327)</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash on background-to-foreground (#335)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where in some instances switching cursor input type (direct&lt;-&gt;indirect) did not work (#298)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the cursor is misaligned when SPICE is installed (#300)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the keyboard strip is too tall or short after an external keyboard is plugged in or removed (#333)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Information</h2>
<p>iOS 13.5 is out. While UTM supports iOS 13.5 and currently does not use the "Psychic Paper" sandbox escape, we still encourage anyone who does not need iOS 13.5 features to stay on stock iOS 13.4.x because we may develop a fork in the future with features that require either sandbox escape or jailbreak.</p>
