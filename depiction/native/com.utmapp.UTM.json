In short, it allows you to run Windows, Android, and more on your iPhone and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/\n\nThis package **requires** AppSync Unified from Karen's Repo. Make sure to add [https://cydia.akemi.ai/][1] to your repository list before installing!\n\n**Note upgrading from < v2.0.22:** The old version of this package installs UTM to /Applications (just like other jailbreak apps). This was an issue because UTM uses sandboxed features and was partially broken when installed that way. Since AppSync Unified was released for iOS 14, UTM now installs the sandboxed IPA directly and as a result your old VMs will not be visible. If you had an older version installed, you need to move your VMs from `/var/mobile/Documents` to a temporary location and then open it from the built-in Files app to import it into the UTM sandbox location. Then, you can delete the old files.\n\n## Features\n\n* 30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V thanks to QEMU as a backend\n* Fast native graphics through para-virtualization thanks to SPICE\n* JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG\n* Frontend designed from scratch for iOS11+ using the latest and greatest APIs\n* Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device\n\n## Notes\n\n* If you wish to keep your VMs, make sure to back them up before uninstalling.\n* Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not). To be safe, make sure you never allocate more storage to a VM than the amount of free space you have.\n\n[1]: cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"osy"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"2.0.27"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 11.0"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Productivity"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"View Source Code","action":"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#1a2cc2"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://cydia.getutm.app/depiction/native/help/com.utmapp.UTM.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#1a2cc2"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2021-04-26","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 2.0.27\n\nNote: this is a hotfix from v2.0.26.

This means non-jailbroken devices on < iOS 13.5 (thanks to Psychic Paper) and ALL jailbroken devices get improved JIT. These devices no longer have the 1/2 JIT cache penalty (and can allocate a bit more guest RAM). The kernel instability from improper exit should also no longer affect these devices and you can now terminate UTM by swiping up from the task switcher.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 2.0b2\n\nUTM 2.0 includes a redesign of the frontend for iOS 14 and introduces support for macOS 11.
