In short, it allows you to run Windows, Android, and more on your iPhone and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/\n\nThis package **requires** AppSync Unified from Karen's Repo. Make sure to add [https://cydia.akemi.ai/][1] to your repository list before installing!\n\n**Note upgrading from < v2.0.22:** The old version of this package installs UTM to /Applications (just like other jailbreak apps). This was an issue because UTM uses sandboxed features and was partially broken when installed that way. Since AppSync Unified was released for iOS 14, UTM now installs the sandboxed IPA directly and as a result your old VMs will not be visible. If you had an older version installed, you need to move your VMs from `/var/mobile/Documents` to a temporary location and then open it from the built-in Files app to import it into the UTM sandbox location. Then, you can delete the old files.\n\n## Features\n\n* 30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V thanks to QEMU as a backend\n* Fast native graphics through para-virtualization thanks to SPICE\n* JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG\n* Frontend designed from scratch for iOS11+ using the latest and greatest APIs\n* Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device\n\n## Notes\n\n* If you wish to keep your VMs, make sure to back them up before uninstalling.\n* Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not). To be safe, make sure you never allocate more storage to a VM than the amount of free space you have.\n\n[1]: cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"osy"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"4.0.1"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 11.0"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Productivity"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"View Source Code","action":"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#1a2cc2"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://cydia.getutm.app/depiction/native/help/com.utmapp.UTM.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#1a2cc2"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2022-08-15","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 4.0.1\n\n**Remember to back up your VMs before running a beta release of UTM!**\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n**iOS**: Visit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n**macOS**: Download \"UTM.dmg\" below and copy the contents to your `/Applications` directory.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features to Virtualization.framework that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Clipboard sharing and directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.\r\n* **Virtiofs sharing for QEMU.** This can be enabled in the VM settings under Sharing. You can mount the tag \"share\" in the VM.

Note that some settings have moved to different categories\r\n* Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.5)\r\n* Fixed latest Linux kernel failing to boot (\u201cEFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...\u201d) (thanks @agraf for the fix) (#2682)\r\n* Fixed freezing during restart of a GL VM (#3746)\r\n* Clarified that clipboard sharing and auto resolution features are the same setting (#3748)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of \u201clegacy input\u201d introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak \u201cForce PS/2 Controller\u201d in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories.\r\n* Fixed \"Failed to create new bookmark\" when trying to launch a VM shortcut\r\n* Automatically de-toggle UEFI boot tweak on unsupported targets\r\n* Fixed a situation that caused UTM to crash randomly (#3515)\r\n* (iOS 14) Toolbar had large overlapping icons on compact devices\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.2)\r\n* Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)\r\n* Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)\r\n* (iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)\r\n* (iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)\r\n* (macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.1)\r\n* Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)\r\n* Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues\r\n* Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14\r\n* (iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows\r\n* (iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation\r\n* (iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)\r\n* (iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)\r\n* (macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.0)\r\n* Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)\r\n* Refactored backend renderer into [CocoaSpice](https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice)\r\n* Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features\r\n* In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window\r\n* Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)\r\n* Added icon for Pop!

After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of \u201clegacy input\u201d introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak \u201cForce PS/2 Controller\u201d in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. (See notes above.)\r\n* Various UI tweaks, fixes, and improvements (thanks @j-f1). Note that some settings have moved to different categories.\r\n* Fixed \"Failed to create new bookmark\" when trying to launch a VM shortcut\r\n* Automatically de-toggle UEFI boot tweak on unsupported targets\r\n* Fixed a situation that caused UTM to crash randomly (#3515)\r\n* (iOS 14) Toolbar had large overlapping icons on compact devices\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.2)\r\n* Fixed leaking of location data in debug.log (#3667)\r\n* Console mode settings for colours are slightly off from the picker values. This has been fixed by using P3 space hex values.\r\n* Retain ordering of VM list when using move, clone, and edit operations\r\n* Show \"unavailable\" VMs when a shortcut is unaccessible due to the VM being deleted or an external drive not being mounted. No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks). This resolves clock issues on some Linux distros (#3104)\r\n* (iOS) Ability to fine tune cursor speed (in Settings) (#2522)\r\n* (iOS) Various improvements to scaling including fixing pinch to zoom on iOS 15\r\n* (iOS) Fixed a random crash due to iOS 15 dyld changes (#3672)\r\n* (macOS) Ability to turn off auto QCOW2 conversion when importing an image as well as the ability to create a raw disk image (#3637)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.1)\r\n* Automatically delete broken bookmarks for removable drives and shared directories after showing the error once (#3575)\r\n* Refactored backend QEMU VM manager to support Swift concurrency and also fix some rare race issues\r\n* Added picker for console background and text colour (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Added font style (bold/italics) for console font as well as font chooser for macOS (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Fixed crash/freeze when using UTM URL actions (#3642)\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: style was incorrect on iOS 14\r\n* (iOS) Keyboard visibility state is now stored globally instead of per-VM\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where the keyboard always pops up when an alert shows\r\n* (iOS) On iOS 13.4, old cursor functionality is restored when it was broken by the iOS 14 cursor implementation\r\n* (iOS) iOS 15 introduced a kernel race that leads to a panic and sometimes a purple screen and device reboot whenever GL is used. This has been fixed by reducing the possibility of the race (while we wait for Apple to fix it in iOS kernel) (#2743)\r\n* (iOS) Better error message when attempting to launch an unsupported architecture in UTM SE (#3635)\r\n* (macOS) Added descriptions to screen resolutions and notch-hiding resolutions (thanks @pointum)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.0)\r\n* Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)\r\n* Refactored backend renderer into [CocoaSpice](https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice)\r\n* Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features\r\n* In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window\r\n* Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)\r\n* Added icon for Pop! OS to picker (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed QEMU custom argument parsing when there is quoted space in middle of the argument (#3579)\r\n* Update the VM screenshot on a timer (#3499)\r\n* Added new global setting to disable saving screenshot to disk\r\n* Improved synchronization of state from the VM window and the main window (play button visible when stopped, busy spinner visible when starting, etc)\r\n* (iOS) Fix crash while installing on older versions of jailbroken iOS (#3543)\r\n* (macOS) Fix an issue where Apple VM aux storage was not created when switching from Linux to macOS boot option\r\n* (macOS) Ability to move a .utm VM to external storage\r\n* (macOS) Toolbar option to delete VM should be disabled when VM is running\r\n* (macOS) Support taking screenshots of Apple VMs\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* iOS 14 and below: There is a known issue crashing while running under taurine but not unc0ver.

This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.0)\r\n* Improved design of wizard on iOS (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @ty-yqs)\r\n* Refactored backend renderer into [CocoaSpice](https://github.com/utmapp/CocoaSpice)\r\n* Updated backend code to use Swift 5.5 concurrency features\r\n* In Apple VM configs, do not discard non-persistent settings (shared directories) when canceling out of settings window\r\n* Add option to run VM as a shortcut (see notes above) (#132, #1205)\r\n* Added icon for Pop!

Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854\r\n* **QEMU v6.2.0**: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2\r\n* (iOS 13+) **New toolbar**: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023\r\n* (macOS 12+, ARM64) **Virtualize macOS 12**: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS installer directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)\r\n* (macOS 11+) **Virtualize Linux with Apple backend**: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from `cortex-a72` to `default`. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the `cortex-a72` CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). `default` will use the `host` CPU model when virtualization is used and `cortex-a72` when emulation is used.\r\n* The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is **not** marked as \"GPU Supported\".\r\n* The cursor and resolution change issues on ARM64 Windows has been fixed in [SPICE tools 0.164.3][3]. If you are using an older version and experience such issues, please update to the latest SPICE tools.\r\n* If you manually added `virtualization=on` to your VM machine properties, you should remove it.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.4)\r\n* Introduced option to disable RNG device, which causes issues on FreeBSD (#3493)\r\n* Wizard: directory sharing is now enabled by default\r\n* Changed the default USB 3.0 controller from `qemu-xhci` to `nec-usb-xhci` which addresses an issue where the DVD drive disconnects randomly on Windows ARM64 and causes random errors during setup (#3194)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed save panel opening when you try to close the settings (#3494)\r\n* (macOS) Hide unsupported directory sharing options in macOS guests (#3496)\r\n* (macOS) Fix invert scrolling option (thanks @ktprograms) (#3497)\r\n* (macOS) Apple VM config files are now in plain-text (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* (macOS) Hide non-disk drives from the drives icon menu and properly describe the \"EFI Variables\" \"drive\" in settings\r\n* (macOS) Fixed suspend save state being broken in a previous update\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when a toolbar icon is hidden due to small window size and a toolbar option is selected from the menu\r\n* (macOS) The stop button in the main window will now stop the VM if it is started\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: Fix disabled button colour being the same as enabled buttons\r\n* (iOS) Moved the toolbar icon lower to not collide with the touch target for showing control center\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where settings are not shown if the context menu is used to open it (#3513)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.3)\r\n* Improvements to download UI (thanks @conath) (#3432)\r\n* Wizard: various improvements to creating Linux VMs (#3472)\r\n* (iOS) Add licensing text to app settings (#3236)\r\n* (macOS) DMG package now has a pretty icon and background (#3257)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference to terminate when all windows are closed (previously this was the default) (#3483)\r\n* (macOS) Fix custom icon for Apple VMs (#3477)\r\n* (macOS) Fix retina mode support for QEMU VMs (note that previously there was a global preference to enable retina mode that is now removed, per-VM setting should be used instead) (#3471)\r\n* (macOS) Remove QEMU VM setting for \"Fit to Screen\" as it was never implemented for macOS\r\n* ~~(macOS) Remove Apple VM setting for \"Retina (HiDPI) Mode\" as it was confusing and is not used for rendering (it just specifies the size of the virtual monitor)~~ This has been reverted in v3.0.4 and the Retina (HiDPI) Mode has been added back. A use for this feature is if you wish to take screenshots at specific resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.2)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed drive delete/move buttons not appearing on macOS 11 (#3461)\r\n* (macOS) Added missing network entitlement for bridged networking on Apple VMs\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: convert VHDX to QCOW2 when creating a Windows VM\r\n* (macOS) Any imported drive on an interface that is NOT floppy, pflash, or none will be converted to QCOW2. This does not apply to removable drives.\r\n* (iOS) Improved toolbar visibility and dimming while idle behaviour\r\n* Wizard: skip drive creation if rootfs image is selected\r\n* Fixed an issue where an imported drive does not use the selected interface\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.1)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed launching on macOS 11 (#3433)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed \"auxiliaryStorage is nil\" when creating macOS VM on M1 Mac (thanks @pointum) (#3429)\r\n* (iOS) Proper enablement of extended RAM usage on M1 iPad 16GB (thanks @kkk669)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash on VM launch on < iOS 13 due to toolbar not being initialized\r\n* (iOS) Version information will now be shown in the system Settings app for UTM (at the bottom)\r\n* Fixed cursor and screen resolution issues on ARM64 Windows after installing SPICE tools. Requires updating SPICE tools to [latest version][3].\r\n* Add virtio-rng-pci device to fix boot warning about randomness source (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Default upscaling mode is now \"nearest neighbor\"\r\n* Fixed floppy drives being read-only (thanks @conath) (#3333)\r\n* Wizard: no longer use NVMe for Windows on x86_64 systems\r\n* Fixed a regression where Windows boots into BSOD often on x86_64 virtualization\r\n* Updated localization for Zh-Hant (thanks @pan93412)\r\n* Updated localization for Zh-Hans (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed an issue where sometimes a VM will not boot due to invalid drive id (thanks @conath) (#3388)\r\n* Changing target to PC (i440FX) will now turn off hypervisor on x86_64 by default because it is unstable (#2420)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.0)\r\n* Added VM creation wizard\r\n* Updated QEMU to v6.2.0\r\n* Updated ANGLE to latest commit\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest commit (this may fix #2743)\r\n* Added `default` and `host` CPU option for ARM64 virtual machines. This will be the default for newly created VMs.\r\n* The downloader will no longer perform CRC checks on the ZIP file and this will significantly speed up extraction.\r\n* (iOS 13+) Redesigned toolbar (#496)\r\n* (macOS) Redesigned VM settings\r\n* (macOS) Fix crash moving drives (#3117)\r\n* (macOS) Make HVF per-VM configurable (#2493)\r\n* (macOS) Add Apple Virtualization.framework backend\r\n* (macOS) New Terminal frontend with SwiftTerm, currently only used with Apple backend on macOS\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization supports virtual serial port through PTY device\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[3]: https://mac.getutm.app/support/"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 3.0.3\n\n## Installation\r\nVisit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **Wizard for VM creation**: Easily create a new VM with the correct default settings with a guided step-by-step wizard.

Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from `cortex-a72` to `default`. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the `cortex-a72` CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). `default` will use the `host` CPU model when virtualization is used and `cortex-a72` when emulation is used.\r\n* The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is **not** marked as \"GPU Supported\".\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.0)\r\n* Added VM creation wizard\r\n* Updated QEMU to v6.2.0\r\n* Updated ANGLE to latest commit\r\n* Updated virglrenderer to latest commit (this may fix #2743)\r\n* Added `default` and `host` CPU option for ARM64 virtual machines. This will be the default for newly created VMs.\r\n* The downloader will no longer perform CRC checks on the ZIP file and this will significantly speed up extraction.\r\n* (iOS 13+) Redesigned toolbar (#496)\r\n* (macOS) Redesigned VM settings\r\n* (macOS) Fix crash moving drives (#3117)\r\n* (macOS) Make HVF per-VM configurable (#2493)\r\n* (macOS) Add Apple Virtualization.framework backend\r\n* (macOS) New Terminal frontend with SwiftTerm, currently only used with Apple backend on macOS\r\n* (macOS) Apple Virtualization supports virtual serial port through PTY device\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 2.4.1\n\n## Installation\r\nVisit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n**Note that some changes require updates to your VM configuration so please read this part carefully.**\r\n\r\n* Cursor disappearing on Windows 10/11 has been fixed with an updated VirtIO GPU driver. Additionally, dynamic resolution (auto-change resolution when VM window is resized) and more fixed resolutions (matching all the screen resolutions of the latest Mac computers) were added to the driver. This requires you to download the latest SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ and run the installer again (or manually updating your GPU driver from the ISO if you know how).\r\n* In v2.4.0, newly created Q35 and PC machine (x86 and x86_64) defaulted to the `Skylake-Client` CPU model. Subsequently, it was discovered that the change caused performance regressions. v2.4.1 reverted the default CPU model to `Default` but if you created a new Q35/PC VM in v2.4.0, it is recommended that you manually change the CPU in System settings to `Default`.\r\n* Since v1.0.0, UTM used the RTL8139 network card as the default for Q35 VMs (x86 and x86_64) and Virt VMs (ARM64). There is a bug in the device implementation that causes the Windows driver to freeze the system and many users reported Windows Installer freezing as well as random freezes through normal use. In v2.4.0, we changed the default network card for Virt machines to `virtio-net-pci` and in v2.4.1, we changed the default network card for Q35 machines to E1000. However, this change only applies to newly created VMs, and any existing VMs may still suffer from the random freeze issues. It is recommended that you change your network card to `e1000` for Q35 machines and `virtio-net-pci` for Virt machines. Windows 7 and above should have the Intel E1000 network card drivers already installed, but the VirtIO Network card requires drivers in the SPICE tools ISO from https://mac.getutm.app/support/ (if you previously installed this, you should have the drivers already on your system).\r\n* (macOS) Since v2.1.2, UTM provided an option (Cmd+,) to \"Use only performance cores by default\" which defaulted to off. When on, any VM which does not have a manually configured CPU count (> 0) will set the CPU count to the number of performance cores on the system. In v2.4.1, we have made this option on by default which means if you previously have not modified this option, then it will now be on. If you turned the option on, it should not change and if you turned the option on and later off again, it should still be off. The reason for this change was because users may not be aware of this option which can result in degraded performance when left off and we believe the default should reflect the best possible performance. Note that as before, if you manually set a VM's CPU count > 0, then this option does not change anything.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* (iOS) Integrated AltKit for automatically triggering AltJIT when installed with AltStore (1.5b2+) and AltServer (1.5b8+) (thanks @JoeMatt)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed sandbox issues (cannot select file) on jailbroken devices (thanks @Halo-Michael)\r\n* Improved zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* Fixed inverted mouse cursor colour in Windows\r\n* New VMs will only use PCores by default (unless manually overridden with Preferences or per-VM config), this also fixes #3180\r\n* Changed default Q35 audio card to intel-hda\r\n* Changed default Q35 network card to E1000 and Virt network card to virtio-net (#3130)\r\n* Removed default CPU for Q35 and PC configurations because the Skylake-Client CPU resulted in performance regression (#3249)\r\n* Fixed downloadVM URL action when the ZIP name collides with the .utm name (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed a race condition leading to crash when a VM is shut down suddenly\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 2.4.0\n\n## Installation\r\nVisit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## New Features (Summary)\r\n* Improved support for SPARC and S390x\r\n* Updated macOS icon thanks to a real designer (@JackHinkle)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* Fixed crash when trying to pause a GL accelerated VM (#3207)\r\n* Configuration should reset more settings when changing architecture\r\n* Fixed UTM exit when deleting a VM\r\n* Fixed an incorrect mapping of removable drives causing an error \"device not removable\" when drives are moved around.\r\n* On ARM64 virt systems, use the virtual USB 3.0 bus for the virtual DVD drive, should improve read times and fix some Windows installer issues (#3194) (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed a crash booting OpenBSD (#3197) (thanks @agraf)\r\n* Fixed a crash caused by a race condition when an error occurs during VM launch\r\n* (macOS) Keyboard mapping accidentally swapped left/right Cmd and Option (#3175) (thanks @zeldin)\r\n* (macOS) Removed \"beep\" when pressing Cmd+key while mouse is not captured (#3217)\r\n* (macOS) Pass Ctrl+Tab to VM even when not captured because it is a common shortcut.

Use `virtio-ramfb-gl` or `virtio-vga-gl` display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration. Note that newly created VMs will default to a \"GPU Supported\" display device on supported architectures but existing VMs must manually change the display device in Display settings. GPU acceleration is still an experimental feature, so it may not work in some situations (including many 3D use cases).\r\n* **EFI Boot**. By default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -> System -> Advanced Configuration -> UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs).
