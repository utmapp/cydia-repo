Make sure to delete unused VMs before uninstalling.\n* Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not).

THIS RELEASE BREAKS SOME EXISTING VMS, PLEASE READ THESE NOTES FOR MORE INFORMATION !!!\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* Removed force drive type to \"virtio\" for \"virt\" machines (#324) NOTE: This breaks many ARM VMs that depended on this behaviour (including the official ArchLinux image). Those will boot into a black screen. To fix, you need to modify the drive and set the \"Location\" from \"sd\" (or whatever) to \"virtio\".\r\n* Display version number in config (#328)\r\n* A warning message is displayed when saving a suspend image is not supported (#310) NOTE: You must have a qcow2 disk image to use suspend. If you only have ISO and/or RAW images, suspend/resume will not work.\r\n* Removed the option to create RAW images. NOTE: this created a lot of confusion because 1) suspend/resume didn't work (see above) and 2) there is no performance benefit against \"compressed\" (qcow2) images. There is also an incorrect assumption that \"compressed\" images will auto-compress the data. That is incorrect, as it only compresses the initial data of all zeros.\r\n* Added an option to set machine properties manually for those who need it (#313) NOTE: Most do not need to touch this new option. It's only use right now is a workaround for mac99 VMs that need to set `via=pmu-adb` on some older versions of MacOS.\r\n* Added more keys to the keyboard strip including \"page down\" needed for installing older versions of Windows (#323)\r\n* Improved debug logging to save more log entries\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed on-screen keyboard broken in RC2 (#329)\r\n* Fixed issue where UTM attempts to resume a VM that has no suspend image (#280)\r\n* Fixed Ctrl+C in console mode (#327)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash on background-to-foreground (#335)\r\n* Fixed an issue where in some instances switching cursor input type (direct<->indirect) did not work (#298)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor is misaligned when SPICE is installed (#300)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the keyboard strip is too tall or short after an external keyboard is plugged in or removed (#333)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\niOS 13.5 is out.

UTM is ready to support Magic Keyboard on day one!\r\n* Added inertia to scrolling. Includes scroll wheel emulation from touch gestures and gamepad joystick.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Shared directory not working (#265). Note that previously, we advertised support for shared directories outside the app sandbox. This feature has been moved to a future milestone as it requires much more work.
