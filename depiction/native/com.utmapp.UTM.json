In short, it allows you to run Windows, Android, and more on your iPhone and iPad. More information at https://getutm.app/\n\nThis package **requires** AppSync Unified from Karen's Repo. Make sure to add [https://cydia.akemi.ai/][1] to your repository list before installing!\n\n**Note upgrading from < v2.0.22:** The old version of this package installs UTM to /Applications (just like other jailbreak apps). This was an issue because UTM uses sandboxed features and was partially broken when installed that way. Since AppSync Unified was released for iOS 14, UTM now installs the sandboxed IPA directly and as a result your old VMs will not be visible. If you had an older version installed, you need to move your VMs from `/var/mobile/Documents` to a temporary location and then open it from the built-in Files app to import it into the UTM sandbox location. Then, you can delete the old files.\n\n## Features\n\n* 30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V thanks to QEMU as a backend\n* Fast native graphics through para-virtualization thanks to SPICE\n* JIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG\n* Frontend designed from scratch for iOS11+ using the latest and greatest APIs\n* Create, manage, run VMs directly from your device\n\n## Notes\n\n* If you wish to keep your VMs, make sure to back them up before uninstalling.\n* Some poorly written jailbreak tweaks cause iOS to go into a reboot loop if you run out of storage (regardless if UTM is installed or not). To be safe, make sure you never allocate more storage to a VM than the amount of free space you have.\n\n[1]: cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"osy"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"2.3.0"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 11.0"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Productivity"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"View Source Code","action":"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#1a2cc2"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://cydia.getutm.app/depiction/native/help/com.utmapp.UTM.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#1a2cc2"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2021-10-10","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 2.3.0\n\n## Installation\r\nVisit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## New Features (Summary)\r\n* **URL automation and VM downloading** (#2670) (thanks @conath) Allows for controlling and downloading VMs with `utm://` URL.

You can configure it in the Network settings for your VM.\r\n* (macOS 11+ and iOS 13+) **GPU acceleration for OpenGL on Linux**. Use `virtio-ramfb-gl` or `virtio-vga-gl` display device and compatible Linux drivers (most modern Linux distros will have it already installed). Windows is not supported because there is currently no virtio-gpu driver for Windows that supports 3D acceleration. Note that newly created VMs will default to a \"GPU Supported\" display device on supported architectures but existing VMs must manually change the display device in Display settings. GPU acceleration is still an experimental feature, so it may not work in some situations (including many 3D use cases).\r\n* **EFI Boot**. By default new VMs created for pc, q35, and virt* machines will have EFI enabled. In previous versions, EFI is only enabled for virt* machines. Due to compatibility with boot, existing pc and q35 VMs will NOT have EFI enabled and must be manually turned on in Settings -> System -> Advanced Configuration -> UEFI Boot. This may also require you to re-install the bootloader on your VM. As part of this change, EFI variables will also be properly handled (on both ARM and x86 VMs). Note that if you've configured a custom pflash device for your VM, the new UEFI Boot option will take no effect (same as before).\r\n* **QEMU v6.1.0** is now used for the backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.1)\r\n* Fix crash when setting custom VM icon (#2387) (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Disable Port Forwarding feature for bridged networking (thanks @conath)\r\n* Fixed memory leak (#2720)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.2)\r\n* (iOS) Enable OpenGL acceleration for iOS 11-12\r\n* (iOS 15+) Increased memory limit for supported devices (M1 iPads currently)\r\n* (macOS) Fix layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey (#2644)\r\n* (macOS) Fix capturing of hotkeys (such as Cmd+Tab) (#2677)\r\n* Disable port forwarding options for shared & bridged networking\r\n* Fixed crash when PPC screamer is selected on iOS (currently this is still not supported)\r\n* Refactored non-OpenGL rendering code, fixing some random crashes seen in TestFlight reports.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.3)\r\n* (iOS) When a mouse/trackpad is already connected when UTM starts up, it will now be properly detected (#3013)\r\n* (iOS) Handle touch and Apple Pencil input while the mouse is captured (#2669)\r\n* Windows BSOD on boot/setup due to `PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA` (#2721)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v2.2.4)\r\n* (macOS) Settings no longer crash when an error occurs while saving a new VM\r\n* (iOS) GL rendering now works on EFI startup (black screen during boot) (#3076)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* v2.2.4 is built with Xcode 12.5.1 instead of Xcode 13.0 beta due to Apple's strict requirements in submitting apps built on beta SDKs. As a result, the layout issues in settings on macOS Monterey are back in v2.2.4.

On previous beta builds, GL is enabled automatically for `virtio-ramfb`. Now, that display device will **not** get GPU acceleration. This is to be more consistent with the other `-gl` display devices. By default, new VMs created will have `virtio-ramfb-gl` selected for `virt` devices (ARM) and `virtio-vga-gl` selected for `q35` and `pc` devices (x86). If you wish to use GPU acceleration on an existing VM, you need to change your display device to one of these two recommended devices (or any device with `-gl` in the name).\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 2.2.2\n\n## Installation\r\nVisit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## New Features (v2.2.0)\r\n* (macOS 11.3+ Only) **Bridged networking and shared networking support**.
